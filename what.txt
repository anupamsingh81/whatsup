4/18/16, 10:14 PM - anupam singh: learned from India.
The author desperately tries to prove in many chapters that Jesus Christ was originally from India. Interestingly, the author has also christened a Tamil name for Jesus Christ ‚Äì ‚ÄúKeshao Krishna.‚Äù
The book says Jesus was dark in complexation and spoke Tamil instead of Aramean, which is believed to be the language Jesus spoke.
Adding more to his claims, the author says that Jesus Christ wore a sacred thread since he was 12 as this was a Brahmin tradition and some time later he introduced a new cult which later became to be known as Christianity.
The author also makes another startling claim when he says Jesus was saved after his crucifixion by people of Essenes cult who later taught him yoga and took him to Kashmir where he prayed to Lord Shiva. According to the book, Jesus spent his final years in the Himalayas and there he attained Samadhi, says the book.

12/7/16, 5:37 PM - anupam singh: How to use paytm for those having non smartphone.

A)

1. Log on to paytm.com
2. Create an account for them
https://paytm.com/login( by entering their mobile number and account password)
Password has one number and one special character line
abcd1@
- tell them to write this  password on piece of paper
4. Once you have done this..
The mobile number you have entered will get an OTP
5.Enter OTP on signup page and their account will be registered.

6. Congrats! Their account is made in 1 minute ..you can now transfer money to their account..

B)

How to use paytm to transfer money on non-smartphone or without internet

Step1. Dial this number from registered mobile number 
1800-1800-1234
It will ask you about setting an MPIN
Confirm.
Step2.
Now you will get a call from paytm to set ur 4 digit MPIN
Set it.
Write down MPIN on a piece of papet

Step3. Congrats now you can use paytm to transfer money without internet and on non-smartphoned.

Step4. Dial 1800-1800-1234 again
Select option to transfer money to paytm(generally it is 1)

Enter the mobile number of paytm account you want to send to.. 

Enter the transfer amount .Eg. 10

You will be asked to enter MPIN

Congratulations.. You will get confirmation of ur transaction.


Thus a person with non-smartphone or smartphone without internet can successfully use it to transfer to money of others.

Kindly try this once and spread widely to create account of those having feature phones(your maid/driver/vegetable vendor)
Teaching them how to transfer to other account on feature phone without internet only.

Kindly spread

Troubleshooting:
1) sometimes the number 
1800-1800-1234 is busy , try it a few times..you will get through
2) sometimes it says you are not registered.. Dont worry dial again.

Considering paytm has become a payment bank now,gives interest up to 6% ,can deposit up to 100000(on KYC- their agents come at home,will give you checkbook n debit card too) and up to 20000(without KYC)
It is a valid option for marginalized section of society.

It also helps you,because you can transfer money to their account without internet for free, and they can do the same.


Spread widely,make it viral.Thanks!

2/15/17, 8:36 AM - anupam singh: Why aren't there price comparison website/apps in health care eg. 
One place angiography 10000, other 7000..and why 

There are 1mg like sites which compare medicine prices..
Why not for doctor services..
2/15/17, 8:38 AM - anupam singh: Website/app company will be a team of medical person..who will help a person navigate through confusing hoops
2/15/17, 8:39 AM - anupam singh: Service, name of hospital, insurance accepted, docs, rating of hospital
2/15/17, 8:41 AM - anupam singh: Two models, you can ask for fees and offer best advice to patients like primary health care doc or..including reference  and other is cut basis from advertising entities.
2/15/17, 8:42 AM - anupam singh: Given 80% of health care is routine procedures, why is this not working ?
2/15/17, 8:45 AM - anupam singh: In a cost conscious society like india, with so much kickbacks by middlemen..will bring much needed transparency to system
2/15/17, 8:48 AM - anupam singh: Consider this same lap. Cholecystectomy costs 50000 at max patparganj n 20000 at shanti mukund with same doc..lots of price differential..
Of course people are finicky about doc quality as well..but cost conscious as well..
2/15/17, 8:49 AM - anupam singh: Personally am of view, this data is going to be of use to a lot of people..both customer n provider
2/15/17, 8:50 AM - anupam singh: The website/app can also offer it's own support in form of docs if it does well.
2/15/17, 8:52 AM - anupam singh: Eg. If you are absolutely cost conscious and want to get a procedure done at a govt hospital, then how to go about it in most effective way.
2/15/17, 8:53 AM - anupam singh: Just bouncing my thoughts..ignore if you have heard of such ideas n they haven't worked in past
2/15/17, 8:57 AM - anupam singh: Of course people want to get best health care, but they want to save money as well..plus lots of uninsured in india.

Apparently i have not finished some part of my work. I reluctantly come back. There are 3 people in office. 2 of them leave withing 5 minutes of me coming in. And Arunabh is sitting on a Chair in a casual manner. I walk up to him. He looks at me and asks me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äú Chaturbhuj Sthan ka naam suni ho‚Äù? I am stunned. For Non Starters, Chaturbhuj Sthan is the Red Light District of Muzaffarpur. I didnt respond. His second question- ‚ÄúHumko Chaturbhuj Sthan Bahut Pasand Hai. Udhar commercial deals hoti hain. Tum Bhi to commercial deal pe aayi ho‚Äù. I was getting where he was leading the discussion to. I avoided an interaction. I said ‚ÄúArunabh, aap bade bhai hain. Meri tabiyat thodi theek nahi hai. Kya karna hai bataiye. Hum karke ghar jaayenge‚Äù He suddenly holds my hand. Says ‚ÄúMadam, thoda role play karein‚Äù. I was stunned. None of this was something i had ever asked for. I ran away. Locked myself in the toilet. And cried. He went away. But i was thinking why the hell he is after me? What did i do to make this happen to me. That was the longest night of my life.

Sydney : The head of Australia‚Äôs Anglican Church expressed sorrow and shame after a government report published on Friday (March 17) said close to 1,100 people had filed child sexual assault claims against the church over a 35-year period.

The interim report, which said most children were aged around 11 when they were abused, came a month after a high-level inquiry into child abuse was told the Australian Catholic church had paid A$276 million (S$297.4 million) in compensation to thousands of victims since 1980.

The report, which was published by the same inquiry, the Royal Commission Into Child Abuse, said the complaints identified 569 Anglican clergy, teachers and volunteers as alleged abusers. There were another 133 alleged abusers whose roles at the church were not known.

Melbourne Archbishop Philip Freier said he felt a ‚Äúpersonal sense of shame and sorrow‚Äù at the way the church had apparently silenced victims.

6/21/17, 10:17 AM - Satish: üéÇ   *Why do Indians resist*  
      .        *paying taxes ?*

_Interesting thoughts on why Indian resist paying taxes, in an open letter to the Prime Minister_. 

_Forwarded as received:_

_Dear Modiji,_ 

_This is what we honest citizens feel about our Governments - Central and State.._.

_On behalf of professionals & businessmen, I am sending you some facts .._

_Please try to unnderstand_.

_We are not doing Tax '"Chori"'... this is tax saving (a bit of evading too)._ 

_This is to ensure security of our family, kids and their future for any adversity._

1. _We bought Generators/Inverter in our houses, because Govt. failed to provide constant electricity._

2. _We installed submersible pumps, because Govt. failed to provide water._

3. _We hired own security guards, because Govt. failed to provide security._ 

4. _We send our kids to private schools, because Govt failed to provide good education in public schools._ 

5. _We headed for private hospitals to avail proper care and treatment, because Govt. failed to provide good public hospitals._

6. _We bought cars because Govt. failed to provide good transportation._
 
_Finally.., what the tax payer gets in return at the retirement, when he needs most to survive ?_

_Nothing, no social security_. 

_But instead all his hard earned income resource is used by Government to distribute subsidies and freebies in the name of welfare schemes among masses to buy "free votes" to those who don't pay any taxes._

_Above all what Govt do with our (tax) money?_

_Open courts-which do not give judgement._

_Open police station which works for politicians only and not protect citizens._

_Open hospital which do not treat us well._

_Build roads wherein 40-100% of money spent goes in vain due to corruption._

_Endless list...._

_Like western democracies, if Indian Government could provide all the above, why would anyone save taxes ?_

_We all know that the major tax revenues collected from us are consumed by Government officials and politicians (billions of dollars are lying in foreign banks)._

_A manufacturer works at a margin of between 2% to 10% , whereas government needs 30% of his income to cover it's expenditure. How fair it is all ?_

_That's the reason no one wants to pay taxes._

_We save taxes for our necessities, family, for our old age, for our safety, security and this phenomenon is the sign of failure of Government in discharging it's own functions fairly and efficiently. Government alone is responsible for this.üò°_

_But on the other hand..._

_We challenge that if Govt announces that Rs.1000 crore is required for Indian Army or floods or earthquake victims !!!_

_The same amount will be deposited within couple of days by these "Tax Savers" only._

_We will come forward with open hearts._

_My dear friends,_
 
_If you agree with this opinion please forward this until the Government realises._

_We shall not only forward this but now time has come we all shall discuss and put this view openly/strongly/boldly through all associations because Govt is openly calling all ‡§¨‡•á‡§à‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® and we notice Govt official continue to black mail us and we notice there is not one percent fall in asking of bribe.._
 *Circulate this message as widely & briskly as possible so that rhe Government is compelled to atleast pay cognisance for our common  good..*

_So hurry ladies and gentlemen!!_

Shared from Gen Prakash Katoch's wall...

*My problem with what's happening in the country* :-  is not about BJP 
and 
Congress, 
Or 
JNU 
and 
anti-nationalism, 
or Jats 
and 
reservation, 
Or 
Hindu Extremism and 
Muslim Extremism, Or 
Beef Ban 
&
Porn Ban, 
Or 
Kejriwal 
and 
Modi, 
Or 
Ravish 
and 
that 'India wants to know' guy*....                                        
*My problem is our mind space being occupied* with futile, 
useless, 
fruitless, 
negative,
 regressive thinking.....

*In an age when this country should be thinking of INVENTIONS and IDEAS* , 

we are discussing subjects mentioned above....

*Why isn't the government 
and media talking about it?*

*Why the subject of debate is not DEVELOPMENT?*

*Why isn't
 RSS 
talking about it?*

*Why isn't every Hindu talking about it.*

*Why aren't the Muslims talking about it?*

*Why the news channels aren't focusing on it?*

*Why Indians on face book not discussing it?*

*Or spreading that idea to the world?*

*Saffron or Green, 
Beef or Chicken, 
Porn or Sanskari channels, 
Temples or Mosques, 
Jats or Kashmiris 

aren't tools of development*...


*These subjects of conversations are ANTI  DEVELOPMENT*  

*And anything that's anti-development is anti-national 

at least for me.....*


*I want to see my India look better than Switzerland.....*

*I want my India to do better than the US in the Olympics.....*

*I want to see my India more civilized than the most civilized country in this world.....*

*I want my India to be more innovative than Japan.....*

*I want my India to be more safe for woman than Copenhagen, Denmark.....*

*I want my India to be more open minded than Canada....*

*I want my India to be better than what it is today....*

*And not worse...*
*And that can only happen when we start thinking productive....*

*Else we will all be wasting time doing something that is useless, 
futile, 
and infertile.                    . . . . . . .........‚Ä¶..........................................   *Please circulate this post.*  *I could have used the half an hour I took to write this, as a reaction to what's happening around, for a better purpose". ..... If you are looking to better national interests forward this message to your all contacts*

7/7/17, 11:49 AM - Satish: #FreeEducation till #Graduation must be Priority 1 for Government...We cannot continue losses as society in name of Education!!!

Based on Labour Ministry Data on Graduate and Jobs Created 
1. Total no  of graduates in 2015...2.5 Crore..
2. Total Avg Cost to become Graduate Nowdays Approx 10 Lakh (Schooling Cost Not Included)
3. Total Cost 2,50000 Crores~ 2 Lakh 50 Thousand Crores..
4. No of Jobs Created 10 Lakh..
5..Average Starting Indian Salary of Fresher 3 Lakh Per Annum 
6. Total Earnings in a year 30,000 Crore

So Every one has to survive in Job for minimum 10-15 years just to pay off of  Education Loans/debt/expense incurred by Parents...

7/9/17, 9:24 AM - anupam singh: It is not surprising then that the most passionate defenses of Amazon and similar companies come from the Brahmins of the company, those that get paid the most, because they have been made to believe, through the whole data-driven mumbo jumbo that they are, LO‚ÄôReal style, ‚Äúworth it‚Äù. The touchy-feely ‚Äúwe care‚Äù side of the company is exposed only to them, which is why they are genuinely gobsmacked when they hear of other employees in the same organization having radically different experiences. For instance Netflix rolled out paid maternity leave to its employees but only in its online streaming side, not the humble DVD-packers or the customer-service reps [Link]. I am sure there is some data-scientist (or a few) who earned their pay here, and a bunch of employees rolling their eyes at the complainers and moochers.

Which brings me to the point of the post. Empathy.

The modern organization, and specially the post-modern one that visionaries like Bezos dream of, do not plan for empathy. Yes empathy needs to be planned for, else it is just a nice word in a CEO note. Empathy means designing redundancy into an organization, such that the lady who has had a stillborn child is allowed a period of ‚Äúlow performance‚Äù because there is someone else who can pick up that work, without making that someone else burn out. That kind of planning of course almost never happens in the modern organization, especially for those at the lower end of the value scale, because the mantra is of leanness, of being pared to the bone, with no redundant cost-centers.

And if you think this is bad, you haven‚Äôt seen the future yet. The next wave of automation is rumbling to shore, and Amazon is at the crest of that.¬†

7/16/17, 9:08 PM - Satish: The last words of Steve Jobs -
I have come to the pinnacle of success in business.
In the eyes of others, my life has been the symbol of success.
However, apart from work, I have little joy. Finally, my wealth is simply a fact to which I am accustomed.
At this time, lying on the hospital bed and remembering all my life, I realize that all the accolades and riches of which I was once so proud, have become insignificant with my imminent death.
In the dark, when I look at green lights, of the equipment for artificial respiration and feel the buzz of their mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of my approaching death looming over me.
Only now do I understand that once you accumulate enough money for the rest of your life, you have to pursue objectives that are not related to wealth.
It should be something more important:
For example, stories of love, art, dreams of my childhood.
No, stop pursuing wealth, it can only make a person into a twisted being, just like me.
God has made us one way, we can feel the love in the heart of each of us, and not illusions built by fame or money, like I made in my life, I cannot take them with me.
I can only take with me the memories that were strengthened by love.
This is the true wealth that will follow you; will accompany you, he will give strength and light to go ahead.
Love can travel thousands of miles and so life has no limits. Move to where you want to go. Strive to reach the goals you want to achieve. Everything is in your heart and in your hands.
What is the world's most expensive bed? The hospital bed.
You, if you have money, you can hire someone to drive your car, but you cannot hire someone to take your illness that is killing you.
Material things lost can be found. But one thing you can never find when you lose: life. 
Whatever stage of life where we are right now, at the end we will have to face the day when the curtain falls.
Please treasure your family love, love for your spouse, love for your friends...
Treat everyone well and stay friendly with your neighbours.

7/20/17, 10:38 AM - Satish: Did you know that at Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the most popular and successful course teaches you how to learn to be happier?__ The Positive Psychology class taught by Ben Shahar attracts 1400 students per semester and 20% of Harvard graduates take this elective course. According to Ben Shahar, the class - which focuses on happiness, self-esteem and motivation - gives students the tools to succeed and face life with more joy._This 35-year-old teacher, considered by some to be "the happiness guru", highlights in his class 14 key tips for improving the quality of our personal status and contributing to a positive life:
üö©Tip 1. * Thank God for everything you have: * Write down 10 things you have in your life that give you happiness. Focus on the good things!
üö©Tip 2. * Practice physical activity * Experts say exercising helps improve mood. 30 minutes of exercise is the best antidote against sadness and stress.
üö©Tip 3. * Breakfast: * Some people miss breakfast for lack of time or not to get fat. Studies show that breakfast gives you energy, helps you think and perform your activities successfully.üö©Tip 4. * Assertive *: Ask what you want and say what you think. Being assertive helps improve your self-esteem. Being left and remaining silent creates sadness and hopelessness.
üö©Tip 5. * Spend your money on experiences..a study found that 75% of people felt happier when they invested their money in travel, courses and classes; While only the rest said they felt happier when buying things.
üö©Tip 6. * Face your challenges *: Studies show that the more you postpone something, the more anxiety and tension you generate. Write short weekly lists of tasks and complete them.
üö©Tip 7. * Put everywhere nice memories, phrases and photos of your loved ones *: Fill your fridge, your computer, your desk, your room, YOUR LIFE of beautiful memories.
üö©Tip 8. * Always greet and be nice to other people *: More than 100 inquiries state that just smiling changes the mood.
üö©Tip 9. * Wear comfortable shoes *: If your feet hurt you, you become moody, says Dr. Keinth Wapner, President of the American Orthopedics Association.
üö©Tip 10. * Take care of your posture *: Walk straight with your shoulders slightly backwards and the front view helps to maintain a good mood.üö©Tip 11. * Listen to music * (Praise God): It is proven that listening to music awakens you to sing, this will make your life happy.
üö©Tip 12. * What you eat has an impact on your mood *:- Do not skip meals, eat lightly every 3 to 4 hours and keep glucose levels stable.- Avoid excess white flour and sugar.- Eat everything! Healthy- Vary your food.
üö©Tip 13. * Take care of yourself and feel attractive *:70% of people say they feel happier when they think they look good.üö©Tip 14. * Fervently believe in God *: With him nothing is impossible! Happiness is like a remote control, we lose it every time, we go crazy looking for it and many times without knowing it, we are sitting on top of it ...

8/2/17, 3:51 PM - anupam singh: Today while a one-kilo packet of Tata salt costs Rs 20, Aashirwad Rs 18 and Saffola Rs 31, Patanjali sells it for Rs 12.

So what‚Äôs their secret? According to Patra, ‚ÄúBaba never cared about what the market prices were. For any product pricing, he was personally involved. He would ask how much it had cost to produce something. Then with a slim margin‚Äîhe just wanted to sell.‚Äù Gunendar Kapur agrees, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt seem to care much about the money, he cares about his own legacy. His margins are very, very low. For formal companies a profit after tax of less than 15 per cent is too low. Their investors will not be happy with that kind of a performance . . . Ramdev does not have such a limitation.‚Äù

8/3/17, 8:09 PM - Satish: 5 types of People you should limit your time when you are chasing your dreams....

1. The Complainer-  these people  always complain about how bad their life and how bad their job is. They constantly complain about it but never do anything to change

2. The entitled person- this people entitled to certain things and Government or system owes them something

3. The conformers- this people just keep confirming what you say but quickly shift to others say too. This people do not have any of their own say or dreams.

4. Party Animals- wants go out for drink every day. They do try to pull you in their routine

5. The doubters- this people fully listen to your dreams but they throw doubt and say may be not a good idea

8/8/17, 9:22 AM - Satish: #Demonetisation cat is out of the bag

A Parliamentary Committee on Demonetisation has submitted its report, which will be tabled during the Monsoon Session of Parliament.

Accordingly, the report calls demonetisation a blunder. Not a single objective has been met, it reportedly says.

Findings of the Committee reveal no major black money was found. It says Finance Ministry accepts that only details of 4,172 crores of suspicious money which could be black. (Prime Minister Modi had predicted 5-7 lakh crores would have been black).

According to the Committee‚Äôs findings, demonetisation had no effect on terror funding. Neither cashless nor was less cash society formed as Finance Ministry was projecting. People have shifted back to pre-November 8, 2016, level cash transactions.

In a further revelation, the report says demonetisation killed small scale industries and major unorganised sector. Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, a trade union affiliate of BJP, has reported a loss of four crore jobs and shut down of over three lakh industrial units. Report has questioned decision making authority and termed all decisions were taken without planning, like size of currencies not planned according to ATMs, 2000 rupees note was brought in without any smaller denomination note to exchange, no considerable amount of currency printed for supply which led to huge rush to banks and ATMs, rules changed on daily basis proved flawed planning. Till date, ATMs remained dry in rural areas.

In a startling revelation, the report says failed demonetisation planning has led to now cut in expenditures of Government on health, education and other vital sectors. Education sector remains most affected as funds have been stopped, fees hiked, and seats decreased for research. Taxes have been increased, interest rates on PPF and other savings scheme reduced.

In view of the foregoing, who will be held responsible for all this Organised Blunder? Who will account for 30,000 plus crores incurred on distribution and all other expenses like advertisements, transportation, extra pay to manpower etc? The question arises who will be held responsible for 180 plus deaths during the whole process?

Will PM Modi account himself before the bar of the people or will Indian democracy continue to be throttled with arbitrary exercise of power by one man government, shorn of collective responsibility? Will Modi go down in the history of India as the first disrupter of its economy by getting away with the aggressive hyper nationalism and any one questioning him as anti-national?

Media euphemistically called ‚Äúpresstitutes‚Äù by one of the NDA Government‚Äôs Minister, have been warned not to bring the report to light.

Rightly, the former PM Dr Manmohan Singh termed it as ‚ÄúOrganised Loot‚Äù. One may recall how Dr. Manmohan Singh in answer to a question from media in his last Press Meet as the Prime Minister on January 3, 2014 had said that Modi as Prime Minister will be a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù, which has been proved now with jobless growth, negligible investments from domestic business houses, fudged data on GDP and ever rising social tensions, straining the very idea of India as postulated by its Constitution and the rule of law based democratic system of governance!

8/10/17, 8:38 PM - anupam singh: nder the Bankruptcy Code, creditors of a defaulting company can drag an insolvent company to the National Company Law Tribunal (or an adjudicating authority set up under the code) and get it declared a defaulter within 14 days. A moratorium can then be declared on creditors, so that the company can function normally till its future is decided by its creditors, and a resolution professional put in charge of running the company. The entire process, from start to finish, has to be decided within 180 days, with a further 90 days being granted for special cases. This means Kingfisher could have been liquidated by the end of 2012, and Mallya taken to the cleaners for his unfulfilled repayment guarantees

8/10/17, 8:40 PM - anupam singh: Currently, the country‚Äôs Bankruptcy Code comprises two basic laws ‚Äì the Sick Industrial Companies Act (Sica), and the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (RDDB) ‚Äì but history shows that neither have worked. Last year, the Supreme Court made things worse when it held that Sica will take priority over RDDB, in a case that began in the early 1990s and concluded only in 2014. The promoters of Arihant Threads managed to evade the creditors for over a decade using the protections and moratorium afforded by Sica. A company under Sica protection cannot be forced to sell its assets to recover loans till a formal rehabilitation package is agreed. (Read here).

The Bankruptcy Code will allow no such leniency and excess recourse to courts, making it difficult for promoters to drag the recovery process endlessly, often after looting the company.
