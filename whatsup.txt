3/9/16, 10:11 AM - Maaruti: Acquire a copy of Brighu Samhita

3/9/16, 10:12 AM - Maaruti: Kaha Jaata hai Ki Jis Ghar me Brighu Samhita Hota hai us Ghar me Dhan Ki Kabhi kami Nahi Hoti

3/9/16, 7:25 PM - Kashif: Nahin gaandu. The fault is patients for going to such a doctor. Lol
3/9/16, 7:33 PM - Kashif: Actually given the current state of affairs everywhere : the fault was the religion of the doctor.
3/9/16, 7:34 PM - Kashif: Which in this case would be the field of medicine and the religious text would be the Harrison . So all doctors who read Harrison should be sued.

3/10/16, 2:05 AM - Maaruti: Kashif sir .. It's good to be not reading than reading a wrong book and claiming that it had been read
3/10/16, 2:06 AM - Maaruti: More so ever more than 50 versions of Manu smriti is present , so doesn't Mather what you read or not .. You would always be wrong .
3/10/16, 2:08 AM - Maaruti: Lastly as I said , Manusmriti is not a book it's just a memory which had been passed so it can't be burnt , so those who are claiming and rejoicing that they burnt something as a mark of protest are wrong on two front , first they don't know what's in there and secondly they are burning what is non existent thing .
3/10/16, 2:08 AM - Maaruti: Counter claims are welcome

3/11/16, 8:07 AM - ANUPAM: But artificial intelligence (AI) has different kinds of long-term consequences: the ethics of creating machines smarter than humans but lacking the ethical-moral impulses that guide human conduct, the possibility of machines trying to dominate humans √† la Terminator, the impact machines substituting humans in occupations hitherto thought incapable of being done without human intelligence and so on. An AI-run factory, goes a joke, employs just a man and a dog. The dog‚Äôs job is to keep the man away from the factory. Why have the man at all, in that case? Someone has to feed the dog. The short point is that the present where automated assembly lines manned by robots still end up needing human control can well be superseded by a future where humans have no role at all in the production process. In the interim, AI will enhance productivity and profits for all companies that can master it and deploy it. Much of India‚Äôs advanced IT services industry might get replaced by AI, unless the industry itself deploys AI

3/11/16, 9:46 PM - pratyush final: All Vijay Mallya needs right now is a statement saying he was harassed by Modi and he's left India due to "Intolerance"

- Nitish Kumar will immediately make him "Bihar ka beta"

- Communist Party will announce him as next "Star Campaigner" in West Bengal.

- Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal will personally visit his London Home and claim how Modi Govt is killing all such "honest businessman".

- Barkha Dutt will visit his home in London and find out that he cannot even manage a decent meal.

And finally,

- JNU students will shout slogans - "Mallya hum sharminda hain, tujhe loan dene wale abhi jinda hain"

As long as Europe had America taking risks, investing ambitiously, and yes, being "inequal," it had the luxury of benefiting from the results without making the same sacrifices. Who will be America's America?

Kanhaiya was arrested because he was present in the video when 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogan was raised which later came out to be DOCTORED/FAKE.

Will Delhi Police arrest Rajnath Singh now ?
3/14/16, 6:27 PM - Maaruti: lol

3/14/16, 7:17 PM - Maaruti: The statement by Ravishankar  was Pakistan Jindabad and Bharat Jindabad is a win win for both the countries , which was reported as Sri Sri Chants Pakistan Jindabad infront of RajNath Singh . Which Newpaper published along with their apology .

3/14/16, 7:40 PM - Kashif: How can Pakistan zindabad slogan be acceptable.  I say it not because it's a 'enemy' state.  Pakistan came into existence only because  of the Two nation theory.  Its a fact that India has a history in millenniums whereas our neighbour has a history of few decades.. 
Raising Pakistan zindabad slogans is akin to celebrating its existence,  and so celebrating the two nation theory.  Whereas our country's survival and not just that,  resounding success,  has shown how utterly flawed this theory was.  Look  at which state is failing and which one is flourishing.
3/14/16, 7:44 PM - ANUPAM: American woman forcing autowala to use meter
3/14/16, 7:47 PM - Maaruti: But the thing is the reporting of the incidents were wrong, that never happened . It was figment of imagination or a deliberate attempt to contort the incidence for which they apologized . The merit or Demerit of 2 Nations Theory ( now 3 ) is always a matter of debate . While we might live in illusion that India is the Best or Pakistan in Worst . They have their own reasons to be proud of . For me The contributions of Patriotic people from the other side of the current border can never be undervalued , it's sheer bad luck that we have to see this .
3/14/16, 7:57 PM - Maaruti: Lastly I believe that we should make ourselves in such a manner that the incidences of past cannot make a repeat

3/20/16, 4:12 PM - apurvaprakash: A TCS couple went to a Sex Therapist office at a BIG Corporate Hospital.

The doctor asked,"What can I do for you?"

The man said,"Will you watch us having sex, for your expert analysis?"

The doctor looked puzzled, but agreed.

When the couple finished, the doctor said,"There's nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse,"and charged them Rs.1300.

This happened several weeks in a row. The couple would make an appointment, have intercourse with no problems, pay the doctor and then leave.

Finally the doctor asked,"exactly what are you trying to find out?"

The man said, ."We're not trying to find out anything. She's married and we can't go to her house I'm married and we can't go to my house. 

The Oberoi charges Rs. 15000,

Taj charges Rs.14000 ,

Le Meridian charges Rs.12500.

We do it here for Rs.1300,

Punch line is yet to come..........

"You must exercise more. Don't buy drinks from stalls or drink beer. Stay away from red wine especially. Drink more plain water. Don't drive when going out. Take public transport or walk. Don't eat out. . Eat less meat especially seafood. Keep to vegetarian diet if possible.

Catches don't always win matches. If the catches werent taken, the no-balls wouldnt be checked and India would have had 10 more (following free hit) to defend in 2 fewer deliveries. The two catches costed India the match.

4/5/16, 7:43 PM - apurvaprakash: I was a very happy man. 
My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year. 
So we decided to get married.
 
There was only one little thing bothering me.
 
It was her beautiful younger sister, Sofia.
 
My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight mini skirts, and generally was Bra-less.
 
She would regularly bend down when she was near me. 
I always got more than a nice view.
 
 
It had to be deliberate.she never did it around anyone else.
 
One day she called me and asked me to come over.
'To check my Sister's wedding- invitations' she said.
 
She was alone when I arrived.
She whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me. 
She couldn't overcome them anymore.
 
She told  me that she wanted me just once before I got married.
 
She said "Before you commit your life to my sister".
Well, I was in total shock, and I couldn't say a word
She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom" she said. 
"if you want one last wild fling, just come up and have me".
 
I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.
 
I stood there for a moment.
Then turned and made a bee-line straight to the front door. 
I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.
 
 
Lord And behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!
 
With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me.
He said, 'Paulie, we are very happy that you have passed our little test.
 
We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter.
Welcome to the family my son..'
 
And the moral of this story is:
 
Always keep your condoms in your car.

As the gentleman had a rare type of blood, it couldn't be found locally.¬†


So the call went out to a number of countries.


Finally a Gujarati in Ahemedabad was located who had a similar type of blood.¬†


The Gujarati willingly donated his blood for the Arab.


After the surgery, the Arab sent the Gujarati as appreciation for giving his blood, a new Toyota Prado, diamonds, lapiz lazuri jewellery, and a million US dollars.


Later, once again the Arab had to go through a corrective surgery.¬†


His doctor telephoned the Gujarati who was more than happy to donate his blood again.


After the second surgery, the Arab sent the Gujarati a thank you card & a jar of Almond halwa sweets.


The Gujarati was shocked to see that the Arab this time did not reciprocate the Gujarati's kind gesture as he had anticipated.


He phoned the Arab and asked him that this time also i thought that you would give me Toyota Prado, Diamonds and Jewellery ... But, you gave only a thank you card and a jar of Almond sweets..


On this the Arab replied ...

'Mota bhai, now I have Gujju blood in my veins!'

4/9/16, 6:14 PM - vishalsatish: Richest Country in the World!
 

 EYE OPENER !!!!!!!!                  

Please forward this email to as many Indians!!!

Right now, India is the richest country in the world! Wondering how? It's really amazing.

(1)  It's due to Mr. G Vaidyaraj, who donated all his wealth, about which he actually did not know.

He is a descendent of Raja Krishnadev Raya from Mysore district.

For the last 300 years or so, three stones were worshipped in his house.But nobody tried to see what it was, except this person, who is a
lawyer by profession. One day, when there was nobody in his house, he took the stone out to see what it was that they worship.
Due to the dust deposited on it, from many many years, it looked only like a simple stone.
But when he touched it, some portion of the stone was cleansed.
And he saw a bright ray of light.

He saw something which attracted his attention. And he was amazed when he cleaned all of them.The whole room was filled with light.
He discovered they were diamonds of about 4600 carats each.

He informed the Govt. of India and the news is censored with its security.
It's now deposited in a Swiss Bank.
The cost of single diamond exceeds the GDP of USA + UK .

Even World Bank does not have enough money to buy it.
India can buy virtually 7 developing nations. 

One diamond costs thrice the debt of World Bank over India .

One such diamond can buy 10 Bill Gates to you.
And the World Bank has proposed the Indian Govt. that it can pay India in Installment if it wishes to do so. 

India 's GDP is 34.25 billion dollars.

Bill Gates property is 95 billion dollars approximate so that is the way 'nature changes'.

Our Prime Minister has refused to sell it.

He said it will be sold or mortgaged for credit when we need it. Otherwise right now we have no problems.

You can go through Times of India with a small column on it a week ago.

Star TV presented a 115 min documentary on it about 15 days ago.

The Hindu with its half page article in it.

After that it was censored as classified.

(2)  Another good news is that in the Desert of Thar RAJASTHAN(BORDERING SINDH) a deposit of Oil and Natural gas have been found. This stores what Kuwait has in its stomach.

India can go with the ONGC energy reserve with another 30 years.And moreover it can export it to other counties.
It's incredible!! But true. 

(3)  An Indian boy in his 12th standard has disproved Einstein's 'Theory of Relativity'.
Shocked? Read on...

Sudarshan Reddy has theoretically proven the existence of a sub-atomic particle, which can travel at speed greater than that of light, thereby challenging one of the fundamental postulates of the 'Theory of Relativity'.

In his recent research paper submitted to the Institute of Advanced Physics (IAP) at Trieste ( Italy ), Sudarshan has proved the existence of a class of sub-atomic particles called leptons', which can travel faster than light. 
The international physics community is shocked by this discovery. 

Dr.Massimo Martelli, President of the IAP has this to say about the paper submitted by Sudarshan. 'After long, careful and critical analysis, I can confidently say that Sudarshan's research papers show tremendous leap in our understanding of physics.
His investigation
mounts up on 'leptons'.. His work builds substantially on the work of Einstein and others in the field of relativity.'
When physicists from Princeton University tried to measure Sudarshan's IQ with an IQ-meter (at the American Embassy in Delhi ), the meter broke down.
Sudarshan, incidentally, is the brother of Madhu Reddy, the Indian whiz kid who developed an operating system superior to Microsoft Windows.
We should all be very proud of these boys.

4/12/16, 9:55 PM - apurvaprakash: Priya is 21 years older than her son. In 6 years from now, priya will be 5 times as old as her son.
  
Question : Where is priya's husband?
(There is a mathematical solution for this. Try it   scrolling down)





























Solution : 

Priya  is 21 years older than Son (Child ).
Priya = Child + 21

In 6 years from now, Priya will be 5 times as old as her Child.

Priya + 6 = (Child + 6 ) x 5
Child + 21 + 6 = ( Child + 6) x 5
Child + 27 = 5Child + 30
-3 = 4Child
Child = -3/4

The child is -3/4 years old, that is, -9 months
Child will be born in 9 months
So, right now, priya's Husband is..


ON TOP OF HER...

4/15/16, 11:32 AM - ANUPAM: Sound so bitter, tells that he was a double dealing opponent..was surprised why he is so popular..
Says , he is a politician ,why call him a mahatma

BBC interview
4/15/16, 11:35 AM - Maaruti: Sir English needed a Dalit leader to Counter Mahatma
4/15/16, 11:36 AM - Maaruti: Ambedkar wanted separate Constitutinal assemblies for Dalit
4/15/16, 11:37 AM - Maaruti: It was shame that Hindus and Dalit had to enter into Poona pact
4/15/16, 11:37 AM - Satish: Dalits are Hindus only Maruti
4/15/16, 11:37 AM - Maaruti: That's the point
4/15/16, 11:38 AM - Satish: Till they convert...Ambedkar did
4/15/16, 11:38 AM - Maaruti: For how long
4/15/16, 11:38 AM - ANUPAM: https://youtu.be/ZJs-BJoSzbo
4/15/16, 11:38 AM - Maaruti: When he became politically insignificant
4/15/16, 11:38 AM - ANUPAM: Complete interview..so much hatred
4/15/16, 11:38 AM - Maaruti: He was Buddha for 2 months only
4/15/16, 11:39 AM - Maaruti: 14 oct 1956- 6 Dec 1956
4/15/16, 11:39 AM - ANUPAM: Ambedkar didn't consider dalits to be Hindus..
4/15/16, 11:39 AM - Maaruti: Precise period
4/15/16, 11:39 AM - Maaruti: And he died on 6 December 1956
4/15/16, 11:40 AM - ANUPAM: If you hear this interview or read his writings , it comes out very clearly .
4/15/16, 11:40 AM - Maaruti: You don't even have to read them
4/15/16, 11:41 AM - ANUPAM: He also had no qualms dealing with British to further lot of his own people( dalits)..good..his own perspective..
4/15/16, 11:41 AM - Maaruti: Sir Ji
4/15/16, 11:42 AM - ANUPAM: Says freedom struggle is a project of Hindu upper caste ( brahmin,bania ) only..üòã
Nationalism a way to suppress dalits..
4/15/16, 11:42 AM - Satish: Every politician does so...no one is messiah
4/15/16, 11:42 AM - Maaruti: He was brought up by Brahmin / education funded by Gaekwads and married less than half age Brahmin doctor
4/15/16, 11:42 AM - Satish: Kya baat Maruti
4/15/16, 11:42 AM - Satish: Impressed with your research
4/15/16, 11:43 AM - Satish: He was brahminwadi ambedkar ...actually his surname is Brahmin surname
4/15/16, 11:43 AM - Maaruti: And the worst part was he said to end caste system you need to deprive Brahmins from education
4/15/16, 11:43 AM - Satish: Just adding 2 cents of my research
4/15/16, 11:44 AM - ANUPAM: Often wondered ..why dalits who have availed quota..hate us so much..they are not facing discrimination in way village folks did..

Realise that they might be reading ambedkar..
4/15/16, 11:44 AM - Maaruti: That was in America radio interview
4/15/16, 11:44 AM - Maaruti: Yes
4/15/16, 11:44 AM - Maaruti: Everyone will suggest you to read Annihialtion of caste
4/15/16, 11:45 AM - Maaruti: Or Ek aur book hai
4/15/16, 11:45 AM - ANUPAM: Now in writing
.the force of ur personality is lost..on social media, in speeches it comes out very evidently...
I realise Ambedkar hated freedom struggle, called it upper caste Hindu project..or felt he did not get his due.m
4/15/16, 11:45 AM - Maaruti: Btw Indian Army has got Mahar Regiment ( the caste which Ambedkar belong )
4/15/16, 11:46 AM - ANUPAM: Sounds almost unhappy n frustrated..
4/15/16, 11:46 AM - Maaruti: And that's truth for every Dalit you will ever come across
4/15/16, 11:46 AM - ANUPAM: Mhar regiment British be banaayi thi kya to counter hindus
4/15/16, 11:46 AM - Satish: @Arvind have you read this book
4/15/16, 11:46 AM - Maaruti: They will feel they don't get their due
4/15/16, 11:46 AM - Satish: Do read to make political career
4/15/16, 11:47 AM - ANUPAM: One of the writings , Ambedkar says to British that untouchables helped British conquer India..and Hindus..
4/15/16, 11:47 AM - Satish: He was illusionary
4/15/16, 11:47 AM - Satish: British conquered India
4/15/16, 11:48 AM - Satish: Because of lazy and aiyaash Rajas
4/15/16, 11:48 AM - Maaruti: And ??
4/15/16, 11:48 AM - Satish: And to add to that selfish migratory genes of Indians for Asrafis
4/15/16, 11:48 AM - Maaruti: lol
4/15/16, 11:48 AM - ANUPAM: http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/49.%20The%20Untouchables%20and%20the%20Pax%20Britannica.htm
4/15/16, 11:48 AM - Satish: To add to that zero unity among small kings
4/15/16, 11:49 AM - Maaruti: In my Defence I will say that if you don't avail the services of Brahmin , it's not Brahmin's loss
4/15/16, 11:49 AM - Maaruti: Never
4/15/16, 11:49 AM - Satish: British maximised that...which any strong country will do in those
4/15/16, 11:50 AM - ANUPAM: He argues in round table conference, to show that he is a benefactor of British..that untouchables helped British conquer hindus-India, so they should be nice to him
4/15/16, 11:50 AM - Maaruti: That's why I said Poona Pact was b/w Dalit and Hindus
4/15/16, 11:50 AM - Satish: Do you believe that...dalits were responsible for our Ghulaami
4/15/16, 11:51 AM - Maaruti: Everyone was responsible for gulami
4/15/16, 11:51 AM - ANUPAM: I get the sense, lots of dalits who might read ambedkar might get radicalized and alienated..
4/15/16, 11:52 AM - Maaruti: Everyone failed their own Mother land and In turn was responsible
4/15/16, 11:52 AM - ANUPAM: Eg. Rohith vemula laughed on Hindus who celebrated diwali and celebrated yakub Menon..
4/15/16, 11:52 AM - Maaruti: One question did British India torture more the upper caste ( as u would say ) or Lower caste ?
4/15/16, 11:53 AM - ANUPAM: Ambedkar was a dalit activist rather than freedom activist..I get this srnse
4/15/16, 11:54 AM - Maaruti: And you are right
4/15/16, 11:55 AM - Satish: My take on this is that if credit for protecting motherland is on king...failure is also on them
4/15/16, 11:55 AM - Maaruti: And he wasn't even that
4/15/16, 11:55 AM - Satish: Leader has to take onus of failures
4/15/16, 11:55 AM - Maaruti: How many kings you can name ?
4/15/16, 11:55 AM - Satish: Credit maximum as well for him
4/15/16, 11:55 AM - Satish: Many
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Maaruti: Like ?
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: Important is you can't think Upper caste was king
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: Or so
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: It's stupid to think like that
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Maaruti: But you didn't answer the question.
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: Kings and Shah have to be blamed for loosing to British
4/15/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: Offcourse
4/15/16, 11:57 AM - Maaruti: Whom did British India trouble more
4/15/16, 11:57 AM - Satish: All
4/15/16, 11:57 AM - Satish: I guess anyone who wasn't toeing to their line

4/15/16, 7:27 PM - ANUPAM: Media has most of folks in humanities who Dont even know about economic issues..whereas economics is most important thing..so now that modi has provided clean government, they focus on traditional fault lines like tiranga, caste projecting India as exploiting minorities

4/15/16, 7:53 PM - Satish: No opposition on next term
4/15/16, 7:53 PM - ANUPAM: I dont know standard definition..but it would be Sharia law as law/guiding principle  of state..

4/15/16, 8:01 PM - ANUPAM: Eg. Hindus might say, we have most intellectual religion and to be honest it does allow atheism in its fold as well..but then you go to villages and see dens of casteism..thankfully reforming..
4/15/16, 8:03 PM - ANUPAM: So, even popular perception or dominant thought is what matters..
4/15/16, 8:05 PM - Kashif: The Sharia was very progressive for its time I.e . 500 ce. In the middle of desert where tribal rule was prevalent. And at a time when most places did not have a written law. It standardized the legal system and prevented abuse by dominant tribe over weak ones. Having said that , I think one cannot apply everything from 500 c.e  in 2016. And I think that is the reason for the current turmoil. It's like using windows 98 version handbook to run commands on windows 10.

4/18/16, 6:03 PM - apurvaprakash: Vikram, 
an IT Professional , was finding himself with an upset stomach every night.

While normal medical checks revealed nothing wrong in him, deeper probes revealed the reason ‚Äì his stomach was collecting significant amounts of wax.

 Doctors identified the villain ‚Äì the ordinary disposable paper cups he used for drinking his tea at his office pantry.

Disposable paper cups have become quite popular in office pantries due to the convenience they offer.

What many overlook is the fact that these paper cups are coated with a tiny layer of wax, which is essential to prevent water from seeping into the paper. 

When very hot liquids are poured into this cup, the paper cups wax may disintegrate and a little may come off, which will promptly be sent along with the drink into our stomachs! While our body can discard minor amounts, over the long-term, it does become a problem. 

So what can be done about it? You can try to bring your own glass cups. 

Glass is one of the least reactive materials in the world (remember acids are stored in glass vessels, blood samples are collected in glass plates ‚Äì these are for a good reason). 

But glass does have the problem of breaking easily, so it requires good care. Ceramic cups are probably the best bet. 

Of course, you can also use your ordinary stainless steel glass, but never use plastic ones ‚Äì they are harmful, and its dangers are even worse than wax ! 

Share if you care.

Could not stop posting 

A man who has gone out of his town comes back and finds that his house is on fire.

It was one of the most beautiful houses in the town, and the man loved the house the most! Many people were ready to give double price for the house, but he had never agreed for any price and now it is just burning before his eyes.

And thousands of people have gathered, but nothing can be done, the fire has spread so far that even if you try to put it out, nothing will be saved. So he becomes very sad.

His son comes running and whispers something in his ear: 

"Don't be worried. I sold it yesterday and at a very good price ‚Äï three times.The offer was so good I could not wait for you. Forgive me."

Father said, "thank God, it's not ours now!"  Then the father is relaxed and became a silent watcher, just like 1000s of other watchers.

Please think about it! Just a moment before he was not a watcher, he was attached. It is the same house....the same fire.... everything is the same...but now he is not concerned. In fact started enjoying it just as everybody else in the crowd.

Then the second son comes running, and he says to the father, "What are you doing? You are smiling ‚Äï and the house is on fire?" The father said, "Don't you know, your brother has sold it."
He said, "we have taken only advance amount, not settled fully. I doubt now that the man is going to purchase it now."

Again, everything changes!!

Tears which had disappeared, have come back to the father's eyes, his smile is no more there, his heart is beating fast. The 'watcher' is gone. He is again attached.

And then the third son comes, and he says, "That man is a man of his word. I have just come from him. He said, 'It doesn't matter whether the house is burnt or not, it is mine.
And I am going to pay the price that I have settled for. Neither you knew, nor I knew that the house would catch on fire.'" 

Again the joy is back and family became 'watchers'! The attachment is no more there.

Actually nothing is changing!

just the feeling that "I am the owner! I am not the owner of the house!" makes the whole difference.

This simple methodology of watching the mind, that you have nothing to do with it..Everything starts with a Thought !

Most of the thoughts are not yours but from your parents, your teachers, your friends, the books, the movies, the television, the newspapers. Just count how many thoughts are your own, and you will be surprised that not a single thought is your own. All are from other sources, all are borrowed ‚Äï either dumped by others on you, or foolishly dumped by yourself upon yourself, but nothing is yours.

Sow a thought, you reap an action.
Sow an act, you reap a habit.
Sow a habit, you reap a character.
Sow a character, you reap a destiny..!

4/29/16, 10:58 PM - apurvaprakash: A newly married couple was walking through a garden suddenly a dog ran towards them.

They both knew it will bite them..

The husband lifted his wife and let the dog bite him than his sweetie.

The dog stopped before them barked for a while and ran backwards.

The husband put his wife down expecting a hug and a few kind words from her.

Then his wife shouted
 " I have seen people throwing stones and sticks at dogs this is the first time I am seeing someone trying to throw his wife at a dog".

Husband...   "üò±üò±üò±üò±"

Moral : A Wife is Wife 

No One ELSE Can MIS-UNDERSTAND a Husband Better, than a Wife

This is a gross underestimation. Consider the fact that in 2013, just luxury car sales ‚Äì of top-of the-line Jaguar, Mercedes. BMW and Rolls-Royce models ‚Äì were over 33,000. Nor do data from the top end of the real estate market really support this number.

Are Brahmins the Dalits of today?



 
At a time when the Congress government wanted to raise the quota for Other Backward Classes to 49.5 per cent in private and public sectors, nobody talks about the plight of the upper castes. The public image of the Brahmins, for instance, is that of an affluent, pampered class. But is it so today?

50 Sulabh Shauchalayas (public toilets) in Delhi; all of them are cleaned and looked after by Brahmins (this very welcome public institution was started by a Brahmin). A far cry from the elitist image that Brahmins have!

There are five to six Brahmins manning each Shauchalaya. They came to Delhi eight to ten years back looking for a source of income, as they were a minority in most of their villages, where Dalits are in majority (60 per cent to 65 per cent). In most villages in UP and Bihar, Dalits have a union which helps them secure jobs in villages.

Did you know that you also stumble upon a number of Brahmins working as coolies at Delhi‚Äôs railway stations? One of them, Kripa Shankar Sharma, says while his daughter is doing her Bachelors in Science he is not sure if she will secure a job.

‚ÄúDalits often have five to six kids, but they are confident of placing them easily and well,‚Äù he says. As a result, the Dalit population is increasing in villages. He adds: ‚ÄúDalits are provided with housing, even their pigs have spaces; whereas there is no provision for gaushalas (cowsheds) for the cows of the Brahmins.‚Äù

You also find Brahmin rickshaw pullers in Delhi. 50 per cent of Patel Nagar‚Äôs rickshaw pullers are Brahmins who like their brethren have moved to the city looking for jobs for lack of employment opportunities and poor education in their villages.

Even after toiling the whole day, Vijay Pratap and Sidharth Tiwari, two Brahmin rickshaw pullers, say they are hardly able to make ends meet. These men make about Rs 100 to Rs 150 on an average every day from which they pay a daily rent of Rs 25 for their rickshaws and Rs 500 to Rs 600 towards the rent of their rooms which is shared by 3 to 4 people or their families.

Did you also know that most rickshaw pullers in Banaras are Brahmins?

This reverse discrimination is also found in bureaucracy and politics. Most of the intellectual Brahmin Tamil class has emigrated outside Tamil Nadu. Only 5 seats out of 600 in the combined UP and Bihar assembly are held by Brahmins ‚Äî the rest are in the hands of the Yadavs.
400,000 Brahmins of the Kashmir valley, the once respected Kashmiri Pandits, now live as refugees in their own country, sometimes in refugee camps in Jammu and Delhi in appalling conditions. But who gives a damn about them? Their vote bank is negligible.

And this is not limited to the North alone. 75 per cent of domestic help and cooks in Andhra Pradesh are Brahmins. A study of the Brahmin community in a district in Andhra Pradesh (Brahmins of India by J Radhakrishna, published by Chugh Publications) reveals that today all purohits live below the poverty line.

Eighty per cent of those surveyed stated that their poverty and traditional style of dress and hair (tuft) had made them the butt of ridicule. Financial constraints coupled with the existing system of reservations for the ‚Äòbackward classes‚Äô prevented them from providing secular education to their children.

In fact, according to this study there has been an overall decline in the number of Brahmin students. With the average income of Brahmins being less than that of non-Brahmins, a high percentage of Brahmin students drop out at the intermediate level. In the 5 to 18 year age group, 44 per cent Brahmin students stopped education at the primary level and 36 per cent at the pre-matriculation level.

The study also found that 55 per cent of all Brahmins lived below the poverty line ‚Äî below a per capita income of Rs 650 a month. Since 45 per cent of the total population of India is officially stated to be below the poverty line it follows that the percentage of destitute Brahmins is 10 per cent higher than the all-India figure.




 
There is no reason to believe that the condition of Brahmins in other parts of the country is different. In this connection it would be revealing to quote the per capita income of various communities as stated by the Karnataka finance minister in the state assembly: Christians Rs 1,562, Vokkaligas Rs 914, Muslims Rs 794, Scheduled castes Rs 680, Scheduled Tribes Rs 577 and Brahmins Rs 537.

Appalling poverty compels many Brahmins to migrate to towns leading to spatial dispersal and consequent decline in their local influence and institutions. Brahmins initially turned to government jobs and modern occupations such as law and medicine. But preferential policies for the non-Brahmins have forced Brahmins to retreat in these spheres as well.

According to the Andhra Pradesh study, the largest percentage of Brahmins today are employed as domestic servants. The unemployment rate among them is as high as 75 per cent. Seventy percent of Brahmins are still relying on their hereditary vocation. There are hundreds of families that are surviving on just Rs 500 per month as priests in various temples (Department of Endowments statistics).

Priests are under tremendous difficulty today, sometimes even forced to beg for alms for survival. There are innumerable instances in which Brahmin priests who spent a lifetime studying Vedas are being ridiculed and disrespected.

At Tamil Nadu‚Äôs Ranganathaswamy Temple, a priest‚Äôs monthly salary is Rs 300 (Census Department studies) and a daily allowance of one measure of rice. The government staff at the same temple receive Rs 2,500 plus per month. But these facts have not modified the priests‚Äô reputation as ‚Äòhaves‚Äô and as ‚Äòexploiters.‚Äô The destitution of Hindu priests has moved none, not even the parties known for Hindu sympathy.

The tragedy of modern India is that the combined votes of Dalits/OBC and Muslims are enough for any government to be elected. The Congress quickly cashed in on it after Independence, but probably no other government than Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs has gone so far in shamelessly dividing Indian society for garnering votes.

The Indian government gives Rs 1,000 crores (Rs 10 billion) for salaries of imams in mosques and Rs 200 crores (Rs 2 billion) as Haj subsidies. But no such help is available to Brahmins and upper castes. As a result, not only the Brahmins, but also some of the other upper castes in the lower middle class are suffering in silence today, seeing the minorities slowly taking control of their majority.

Anti-Brahminism originated in, and still prospers in anti-Hindu circles. It is particularly welcome among Marxists, missionaries, Muslims, separatists and Christian-backed Dalit movements of different hues. When they attack Brahmins, their target is unmistakably Hinduism.

So the question has to be asked: are the Brahmins (and other upper castes) of yesterday becoming the Dalits of today?

5/13/16, 8:45 PM - apurvaprakash: Seven Leadership Principles to learn from an eagle..

(1)  Eagles fly alone and at high altitudes. 
They don't fly with sparrows or other small birds. 

Stay away from (narrow minded people)  sparrows and ravens, those that bring you down.
 Eagles fly with Eagles. Keep good company. 

(2) Eagles have an accurate vision. They have the ability to focus on something as far as 5km. 
No matter the obstacles, the eagle will not move his focus from the prey until he grabs it.

Have a vision and remain focused no matter what the obstacle and you will succeed.

(3) Eagles do not eat dead things. They feed only on fresh prey. 

Do not rely on your past success, keep looking for new frontiers to conquer. Leave your past where it belongs, in the past. 

(4) Eagles love the storm. When clouds gather, the eagles get excited. The eagle uses the storm‚Äôs wind to lift it higher. Once it finds the wind of the storm, the eagles uses the raging storm to lift him above the clouds. This gives the eagle an opportunity to glide and rest its wings. In the meantime, all the other birds hide in the leaves and branches of the trees. 

Face your challenges knowing that these will make you emerge stronger and better than you were. We can use the storms of life to rise to greater heights. Achievers are not afraid of challenges rather they relish them and use them profitably.

(5) When a female eagle meets a male and they want to mate, she flies down to earth with the male pursing her and she picks a twig. She flies back into the air with the male pursuing her.
Once she has reached a height high enough for her, she lets the twig fall to the ground and watches it as it falls. The male chases after the twig. The faster it falls, the faster he chases until he reaches it and has to catch it before it falls to the ground, then bring it back to the female eagle.

The female eagle grabs the twig and flies to a much higher altitude, and then drops the twig for the male to chase.
This goes on for hours, with the height increasing until the female eagle is assured that the male eagle has mastered the art of picking the twig which shows commitment, then and only then, will she allow him to mate with her!

Whether in private life or in business, one should test commitment of people intended for partnership.

(6) Eagles prepare for training. They remove the feathers and soft grass in the nest so that the young get uncomfortable in preparation for flying. 

Leave your comfort zone, there is no growth there.

(7) When the Eagle grows old, his feathers become weak and cannot take him as fast as he should. 
When he feels weak and about to die, he retires to a place far away in the rocks. 
While there, he plucks out every feather on his body until he is completely bare. He stays in this hiding place until he has grown new feathers  then he can come out. 

We occasionally need to shed off old habits, things that burden us, or add no value to our  lives.

Yes eagles never give up ...

So keep moving. 

Your Best is yet to come .üëç

5/13/16, 8:51 PM - apurvaprakash: PATIENT BEHAVIOUR. ..

A doctor's version of dealing. ..
With it. .

(Forwarded as received )


Elderly  lady  (and husband )came with 
Post menopausal bleeding; being
Neighbours;  got 
Free consultation and free scanning from me.

Thick endometrium on TVUS
 I advised endometrial biopsy

And they disappeared
And reappeared with biopsy report
Biopsy done elsewhere for an astronomical price

Atypical  hyperplasia

'We could have done it here, for cheaper price'...? I asked politely shrugging my arms

'Sorry our daughter insisted, so we decided there'

Okay

'Its better to have a hysterectomy' ; I suggested

And they did the disappearing act again

Later they came with HPE of hysterectomy specimen

Hysterectomy done at the daughter's choicest place
For an astronomical sum again

'No cancer, nothing to worry, I reassured them'

And politely asked

'You could have done this here too'

'Sorry our daughter insisted'

'Now, why are you here...?'

'We need reimbursement bills to be signed'
And fitness certificate too'

'But that's given by the concerned doctors, right...?'

I asked politely

'No, our daughter said you can sign and issue'

That's it
Crossed the limit 

I sent my office assistant to fetch my daughter 

When she came to the room I asked her

'Can I give them the certificates,  which they're asking..?'

Visibly puzzled she stared at me

And I told the couple

'Sorry, my daughter doesn't seems to like the idea, 

'like you, I also follow whatever my daughter says'

SORRY
I stood up and they left

I hate to misbehave 
Patients have their right to choose

But, taking someone for a ride
That's cruelty .

PS :
Someday one has to learn to behave like this also.

5/14/16, 6:24 PM - ANUPAM: In China, there is a company work culture at startups that's called 9/9/6. It means that regular work hours for most employees are from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. If you thought Silicon Valley has intense work hours, think again.

For founders and top executives, it's often 9/11/6.5. That's probably not very efficient and useful (who's good as a leader when they're always tired and don't know their kids?) but totally common.

Teams get locked up in hotels for weeks before a product launch, where they only work, sleep and work out, to drive 100 percent focus without distractions and make the launch date. And while I don't think long hours are any measure of productivity, I was amazed by the enormous hunger and drive.
5/14/16, 6:25 PM - ANUPAM: 9/9/6 reminds me of a doctor's workday in private sector

Monica Lewinsky released the following statement on Hillary Clinton's run for President:

"I will not vote for Hillary Clinton. The last Clinton Presidency left a bad taste in my mouth. As we get closer to November of this election year, citizens must remember that they cannot trust Hillary Clinton to create American jobs. The last time she had a meaningful job, she outsourced it to me. And I simply blew it!

5/17/16, 2:28 PM - apurvaprakash: Kenya is 2 hrs ahead of Nigeria, but it does not mean that Nigeria is slow, or that Kenya is fast. Both countries are  working based on their own "Time Zone."

Some one is still single.. Someone got married and 'waited' 10 yrs before having a child, there is another who had a baby within a year of marriage.

Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a good job; and there is another who graduated at 27 and secured employment immediately!

Someone became CEO at 27 and died at 52 while another became a CEO at 50 and lived to 90 years. 

Everyone works based on their 'Time Zone'
People can have things worked out only according to their pace. Work in your ‚Äútime zone‚Äù.

Your Colleagues, friends, younger ones, all are in different  'Time Zone.' You are in yours!

Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. Things workout, You‚Äôre not late ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre very much On time!

5/18/16, 11:41 AM - apurvaprakash: A newly wed couple had only been married for two weeks.  Husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out in town and party and drink with his old buddies. So, he said to his new wife, 'Honey, I am going out and will be back soon.

'Where are you going honey bunch?' asked wife.

I'm going to the bar, pretty face. I'm going to have a beer.'

Wife said, 'You want a beer, my love?' 
She went and opened the door of the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 different countries - Germany, Holland, Japan, America, etc.

Husband didn't know what to do, the only thing that he could think of saying was, 'Yes, lolly pop but at the bar U know they have
frozen glasses.'

He didn't get to finish the sentence, because wife interrupted him by saying - 'You want a frozen glass puppy face?' 
She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.

Husband, looking bit pale, said, 'Yesss.. Tootsie roll, but at the Bar they have those kebabs, that are really delicious.. I won't be long. 
I'll be right back. I promise.. Okkk?

'You want  kebabs poochie pooh?' She opened the oven and took out 5 dishes of different types of ready to eat kababs, chicken wings, cutlet, mushroom caps and  strips, etc.

'But my sweet honey.. 
At the barrr... U know... There's swearing, dirty words and all that..'

'You want dirty words, you bastard?? 
Drink your fucking beer Bhenchod in your damn frozen mug Madarchod and eat your shitty snacks, bcoz you have got married now and you aren't going anywhere!! 
Got it, Bhen ke laude?'

So he stayed home
And, they lived happily ever after..

5/18/16, 4:41 PM - apurvaprakash: Landmark formula for compensation by Supreme Court. (70 -  age) x annual income  + 30% for inflation -  1/3 for expenses. Hence if a 35 year old person dies due to medical negligence and has a monthly income of 2 lakhs  (70-35) x 24lakhs = 8.4 crores. Add 30% =10.92 cr  -  1/3 for expenses he would have incurred if he was alive = 7.28 crores. Add mental anguish to the family and litigation costs. So about  8 -  9 crores. 

If income is 5 lakhs per month, compensation will be over  20 crores. 
Hence during  History Taking  do not forget to ask monthly income to determine whether you can afford the patient. There was a time when patients asked before hospitalization about  approx costs. Now the doctor should determine whether he can afford the patient.

5/26/16, 7:47 AM - apurvaprakash: A local FM Radio was running a contest, and I phoned up. The RJ said, "Congratulations on being our first caller, all you have to do is answer the following question correctly, to win our grand prize."

"That's fantastic!" I shouted in delight.

"Feel confident?" she asked. "It's a maths question."

"Well, I've got a Masters in maths and have been teaching maths for 35+ years," I proudly replied.

"Ok then, to win our grand prize of 2 front row seats for Rahul Gandhi's speech and to meet him back stage, ... What is 2+2?"

I replied, "7"

Jo tere apne hoge wo laut aaege kisi roz...

Galibs reply to Iqbal~~

Na rakh Umeed-e-wafa kisi parinde se Iqbal
Jab par nikal aate hai apne bhi aashiyana bhool jate hai...

Ghalib continues....

Khuda ki mohabbat ko fana kaun karega?
Sabhi bande nek ho to gunaah kaun karega?

Ae khuda, mere dosto ko salamat rakhna

Warna meri salamati ki dua kaun karega

Aur rakhna mere dushmano ko bhi mehfooz
Warna meri tere paas aane ki duaa kaun karega....!!!

Q: Describe the Revolt of 1857.  

Answer  : The Revolt of 1857 was also called the first war of india's independece. The war is started at some where in India region. It is very War of War because india is fighting with the help a Small Knife meanwhile british are using 303 rifle shooting cats and dogs. the india men says...."banduuk mar diya.. Bharat mata ki Jai" they are shouting like anything the shout sound in Kerela side is heared in Delhi also very loud and clear the mumbai side shout in Tenor Kolkata side in Bass Gujarat side in Contralto and the Zomis are Suprano at that very time. 

Suddenly Mahatma Gandhi Heared the cry of india people cry and is angry like a bengal tiger and take out his Saree came out of his hole with one Single Barrel but he did not have the bullet he asked subhas chandra bose. Tipu Sultan came out with his horse Akbar joined him Rani Laxsmi Bai also escort him they become united we stand and beat the british police like anything they beat to London and they came back with Freedom Memento happily.

Thus, revolt of 1857 is a success revolt. And so Bankim Chandra Chatterjee wrote the Jana gana mana and do the solfa putting himself.

RESULT : NICELY  FAILED

6/4/16, 7:51 AM - Maaruti2: Aur Mehnat Se Jayada Kisi Ko agar Kooch hai to Usme cheating hai
6/4/16, 7:51 AM - Kashif: Mehnat Aur success has no direct correlation
6/4/16, 7:52 AM - Maaruti2: Results may vary marginally depending on the minor adjustments they make during Mehnat
6/4/16, 7:52 AM - Maaruti2: Shayad Se
6/4/16, 7:52 AM - Maaruti2: But for me Yes
6/4/16, 7:53 AM - Maaruti2: I have never got anything more than what I have worked for nor anything less
6/4/16, 7:53 AM - Kashif: gareeb majdoor se jyada mehnat karte ho tum
6/4/16, 7:53 AM - Maaruti2: Mehnat is not always physical Labour
6/4/16, 7:53 AM - Maaruti2: I can't expect to pass in an exam just because I trained hard at nets in cricket
6/4/16, 7:54 AM - Maaruti2: That's a very poor argument
6/4/16, 7:54 AM - Kashif: Chalo koi Nahin . Discussion topic change kar diya tumme
6/4/16, 7:54 AM - Maaruti2: Topic change Nahi Hua hai
6/4/16, 7:54 AM - Maaruti2: Topic Wahi hai
6/4/16, 7:54 AM - Kashif: Answer Nahin diya tumne in clear terms
6/4/16, 7:55 AM - Maaruti2: I am sure I didn't pass because of Raham of professor
6/4/16, 7:55 AM - Kashif: Did you have more than 80% attendance in all subjects that you passed
6/4/16, 7:55 AM - Maaruti2: Jis viva me answer diye Usme pass Nahi to fail

6/4/16, 7:59 AM - Kashif: Professor bhi khush Aur hum bhi khush.
6/4/16, 8:01 AM - Maaruti2: And I have no shame nor any regret in admitting I have got what I have deserved
6/4/16, 8:04 AM - Maaruti2: Neither a gm more nor less . God had adequately awarded me in proportion to my effort
6/4/16, 8:06 AM - Kashif: Kuch der pehle toh tumne kahan ke Reham toh hum bhagwan se bhi Nahin lete. I am confused now
6/4/16, 8:06 AM - Maaruti2: Raham Nahi hai Ye
6/4/16, 8:06 AM - Kashif: Agar mehnat ka mila toh Bhagwan ne kiya award kiya.
6/4/16, 8:07 AM - Maaruti2: Karam hai
6/4/16, 8:07 AM - Kashif: Bhai rehmat ka doosra naam ashirwaad hain.
6/4/16, 8:07 AM - Kashif: Toh karam mein Bhagwan kahan se aa Gaye
6/4/16, 8:08 AM - Maaruti2: Karam Bhagawan hi hai
6/4/16, 8:08 AM - Kashif: If you believe in hard work and appropriate return for that hard work then don't bring God into the equation. Because God makes every equation unpredictable
6/4/16, 8:09 AM - Maaruti2: God never makes any thing unpredictable
6/4/16, 8:10 AM - Maaruti2: He knows what you are doing and that's all
6/4/16, 8:10 AM - ANUPAM: Luck/God whatever you call is big
6/4/16, 8:10 AM - ANUPAM: Very important..
6/4/16, 8:10 AM - Kashif: Jai ho. Anupam
6/4/16, 8:11 AM - Maaruti2: Sir luck is Important but we don't leave anything to it
6/4/16, 8:11 AM - Kashif: I agree with anupam.
6/4/16, 8:11 AM - Maaruti2: If I chose to play when I needed to study and I fail in any exam how can I blame luck for it
6/4/16, 8:12 AM - Kashif: Because your luck told you to play instead of studying üòÑüòÄ
6/4/16, 8:12 AM - Maaruti2: All I know is Anything I do I do it at my own cost or future , including typing right now
6/4/16, 8:12 AM - ANUPAM: True, but with 10 people with adequate preparation in football field, you have to be lucky to get ball to score it , of course there would be hundreds without adequate preparation,..üòä
6/4/16, 8:14 AM - Maaruti2: Haan till we reach to the age of robots we will call the factor or human error as Luck
6/4/16, 8:18 AM - Kashif: Even robots make mistake. üòÄüòÑ
6/4/16, 8:20 AM - Maaruti2: Haan ManMohan Singh did
6/4/16, 8:20 AM - Maaruti2: Anyways If any one trusts God I am sure he ( including me ) would believe that he will never do any injustice
6/4/16, 8:21 AM - Kashif: How do you define injustice
6/4/16, 8:23 AM - Maaruti2: I am no one do define it . The supreme will decide and deliver
6/4/16, 8:23 AM - Maaruti2: üëªüëªüëª
6/4/16, 8:25 AM - ANUPAM: 1.My experience
Teaching at MAMC sucked.
2. Hardly few teachers who inspired.
3. I didn't pass with rehmokaram but if I would have been mentored properly it would have been 20 times easier with better knowledge
4.Doctors at govt hospitals in Delhi, should have their teaching part of salary cut . ( There is good teaching in pre n para clinics)
5. Teachers in Delhi enjoy disproportionate influence, no 360 degree evaluation. Eg. USA they are evaluated back . places like Bihar n UP are also better in a perverted sense that teacher would get beaten if doesn't teach at all or behaves rudely. ( 360 degree feedback)..
6/4/16, 8:26 AM - Maaruti2: Agreed
6/4/16, 8:26 AM - Maaruti2: My college days were over after   Hemat lecture by Daya Ram
6/4/16, 8:27 AM - Abhishek: Arre 
Achanak MAMC ke peeche kyoin lag gaye...
6/4/16, 8:27 AM - ANUPAM: Places like west Bengal, certain places in UP(KGMC,BHU) have excellent clinical teaching.Delhi is way overrated.
6/4/16, 8:27 AM - Abhishek: Teacher ko assess back karne ke liye class bhi jana padta hai?
Or
OBH tv room mein teachers interview?
6/4/16, 8:29 AM - ANUPAM: Daya ram was good as in he was not rude. Well I attended many lectures in my second prof n clinical, after being detained in first prof because of attendance..üòã
6/4/16, 8:29 AM - Abhishek: I must tell you that
Mamc teaching was way ahead other colleges
Even considering internship... Except few departments
6/4/16, 8:30 AM - Kashif: Arvind tum chup kyun ho. You can provide perspective from both sides.
6/4/16, 8:31 AM - Kashif: Anupam I agree there is a huge difference in teaching between india and USA
6/4/16, 8:31 AM - ANUPAM: So I know, what I am talking about. I disagree with what abhishek says, in particular serious issues with medicine teaching in MAMC at my time. Of course my experience, sample size = 1.
6/4/16, 8:31 AM - Abhishek: It was not personal Pom
We all use to bunk classes.
In my minor posting
I never went to surgery and gynae ward. Didnt even come to know their location.
How can i judge their teaching?
6/4/16, 8:32 AM - Kashif: But abhishek singh has a point
6/4/16, 8:32 AM - ANUPAM: I attended all surgery and gynae wards abhishek .
6/4/16, 8:32 AM - Abhishek: I didn't POM
6/4/16, 8:33 AM - Maaruti2: üëªüëª
6/4/16, 8:33 AM - Maaruti2: Rahne dijiye
6/4/16, 8:33 AM - Maaruti2: UG days are over
6/4/16, 8:33 AM - ANUPAM: I actually did, became serious after being detained in first prof because of attendance.üòã
6/4/16, 8:33 AM - Kashif: After attending lectures here in USA by attendance in my masters class was 100%. My attendance in MBBS was barely 50%
6/4/16, 8:33 AM - Maaruti2: At the end of the day , it all evens out . If we have in it to succeed we will
6/4/16, 8:34 AM - Kashif: Satish can attest to my attendance from 3rd year onwards . Lol
6/4/16, 8:34 AM - Maaruti2: Yes Kahsif Sir we never went like going to college because we found it terrible waste of time , when we could waste it in other forms of entertainment
6/4/16, 8:36 AM - Kashif: Knowing what I know now , if given a. Chance I would be more serious in medical school. But then again the people skills that I learnt by not going to college is unique and has helped me in life situations
6/4/16, 8:37 AM - ANUPAM: I still think with good clinical teaching, inspiration many medical students could be inspired to try harder. At end of my medical school , I was a robot aiming to crack PG. It was actually in PG, I got sense of being a clinician.
6/4/16, 8:39 AM - Maaruti2: Lectures are such a waste of time and exams like More of it . Someone should be daily assessed
6/4/16, 8:39 AM - Maaruti2: üëªüëª
6/4/16, 9:01 AM - Abhishek: Please stop comparing USA and India 
two different country 
Totally different...
6/4/16, 9:08 AM - Kashif: But we can learn the good things from them
6/4/16, 9:32 AM - Abhishek: Yes i agree...
But it doesn't mean that what we have is bullshit
6/4/16, 9:33 AM - Kashif: I never said that.
6/4/16, 9:34 AM - Abhishek: Oh! I am not telling you...
6/4/16, 9:36 AM - Abhishek: Looking within india
MAMC has good standard of teaching. No doubts
Of course we cant compared it with USA
6/4/16, 9:37 AM - Abhishek: and its not over rated...
May be i am in Bihar and seeing PMCH, NMCH students condition
6/4/16, 11:40 AM - Maaruti2: Kar lijiye Sarkari Sewa

6/8/16, 4:00 PM - apurvaprakash: The psychopath test ...

Read this question, come up with an answer and then scroll down to the bottom for the result.  This is not a trick question. It is as it reads. A few people have come up with the correct answer !!
 

A woman, while at the funeral of her mother, met a guy whom she did not know. She thought this guy was amazing. She believed him to be her dream guy so much that she fell in love with him right there, but never asked for his number . Much as she tried, she could not find him. A few days later she killed her sister.

Question: Why did she kill her sister?

 Answer:
 

She was hoping the guy would appear at the funeral again.

 

If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath.  This was a test by a famous American Psychologist used to determine if one has the same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question correctly.
 

If you didn't answer the question correctly, good for you. If u did, time to visit a doctor   ... ... ...üò≥

6/8/16, 8:41 PM - pratyush final: *Is it LEGALLY VALID to order Striking Doctors to pay compensation for alleged death of patients due to (during the  period of) the Strike?*

The judgment in Moti Lal Yadav vs. State of UP Thru. Chief Secy. Civil Sectt. Lko. & 5 Ors., Misc. Bench No.13501 of 2016, Date of Judgment: 2.06.2016, by the Allahabad HC  is *a very serious issue. The Hon'ble HC seems to have committed the illegalities / errors*.
 
BTW, full comments can be made only after viewing a copy of the full judgment.

MY COMMENTS:
 
 
 
1--The HC seems to have stated that doctors don't have a right to strike. This is against an earlier SC judgment where Dr. Kunal Saha was the petitioner. Strike is a right of all employees.
 
2-- The HC has no business to loosely state that "huge" budget is allocated to health. India is almost at the bottom in this regard. The health budget is a measly 1.3% of the GDP.
 
3--The HC has wrongly stated that a doctor is bound to treat everybody. Such binding cannot operate when doctors are on a declared strike. The duty to provide health facilities to the citizens lies with the government, not its employees. It is for the government to discharge that duty or to be penalised for non-discharge of such duty. The penalty of Rs. 25 lakh per death would be welcome to the families of the deceased, but there is no rationale for deducting it from the salary of striking doctors. *Let it be deducted from the salaries of the health bureaucrats whom the HC has criticised in no uncertain terms*.
 
4--Presuming that the striking doctors were not among the respondents, the HC had no business punishing them without giving them a hearing. The WP was disposed of at the time of the first hearing itself. What was the hurry? Why were not the doctors heard? *This is plain murder of principles of natural justice*.
 
4--The IMA must challenge this judgment. As per para 13(a), the HC has ordered the formation of a HPC (High Powered Committee) to conduct an inquiry. The IMA and the Resident doctors must submit memoranda to the Committee. They should be drafted with proper legal inputs.  
 
5--I do not know whether the strike was initiated with proper legal planning. Most probably it was not. This is what lacks in most strikes by doctors and this is why most of them fail. The strike by BMA was carried out after months of planning. The IMA has sorely failed in its responsibility to the medical profession, especially the resident doctors, by ignoring their problems and not fighting for them in a legally planned manner.

6/8/16, 9:16 PM - Maaruti2: As far as I remember when we went on a strike , the judgement that came about action against striking doctors the court had used the statement ' State should act as a Model Employeer ' with suggestion that no Punitive action must be initiated against the striking doctor  . Anyways I feel the movement this case will be referred to the higher Bench or will be challenged in the higher court that decision will be overturned . But yes IMA of all respective states should challenge this judgement in their court . Best wishes

Three Fucking Laws of Management - If you learn them, no one can beat you in Corporate Management, but unfortunately even Harvard Business School does not teach them.


1. Fucking Law of Delivery Time - 

No matter how hard and fast you fuck, 

the child comes after 9 months.

Moral - Pressurizing does not alter delivery period.


2. Fucking Law of Direction - 

Even though both holes  are nearby, if by a wrong shot, you enter the wrong hole, 

no matter how hard you fuck, you never get a child.

Moral - Right direction is very important to get the results, even few centimeters away from right direction, even if it gives satisfaction, cannot lead to results.

3. Fucking Law of Human Resources - 

By appointing 4 men to fuck 1 woman, you cannot get 4 children, 

but if you appoint one man and 4 women, you can get 4 children.

Moral - Appoint the right person at the right position. Otherwise you would keep on wondering, why you are not getting the results even after appointing more men.

6/17/16, 10:37 PM - pratyush final: An elephant and a dog became pregnant at same time. Three months down the line the dog gave birth to six puppies. Six months later the dog was pregnant again, and nine months on it gave birth to another dozen puppies. The pattern continued.
On the eighteenth month the dog approached the elephant questioning, "Are you sure that you are pregnant? We became pregnant on the same date, I have given birth three times to a dozen puppies and they are now grown to become big dogs, yet you are still pregnant. Whats going on?".
The elephant replied, "There is something I want you to understand. What I am carrying is not a puppy but an elephant. I only give birth to one in two years. When my baby hits the ground, the earth feels it. When my baby crosses the road, human beings stop and watch in admiration, what I carry draws attention. So what I'm carrying is mighty and great." 
Don't lose #faith when you see others receive answers to their prayers. Don't be envious of others testimony. If you haven't received your own blessings, don't despair. Say to yourself "My time is coming, and when it hits the surface of the earth, people shall yield in admiration." Amen! Enjoy the rest of the week. #TheSacredWord #LifeLessons #TrustYourJourney #DontCompareYourDeliveryDate #GodsTimingIsPerfect #Patience #Love #Trust

**********************
A daughter asked her dad if she has ever made him cry in front of her before, because she don‚Äôt remember ever seeing him cry.

He said, ‚ÄúOnce.‚Äù 

He told her that when she was 3 years old, he laid out a pen, a rupee, and a toy in front of her. He wanted to see which one she would pick‚Ä¶ it represents what you‚Äôll value most when you grow up. Like the pen is intelligence, money is wealth and the toy is fun.

He was just doing it out of curiosity. It was interesting for him to see which one she would pick anyway.

He said that she just sat there and stared at the items. He sat across from her and waited patiently.

According to him, she crawled towards them, he held his breath, and she pushed everything aside and went straight into his arms.

He didn‚Äôt realize that he was one of the choices. And that was the first, and the only time she made him cry ...
Happy Father's Day

6/24/16, 1:49 PM - apurvaprakash: It is never too old to dream !!!

At age 5 his Father died.
At age 16 he quit school.
At age 17 he had already lost four jobs.
At age 18 he got married.
Between ages 18 and 22, he was a railroad conductor and failed.
He joined the army and washed out there.
He applied for law school he was rejected.
He became an insurance sales man and failed again.
At age 19 he became a father.
At age 20 his wife left him and took their baby daughter.
He became a cook and dishwasher in a small cafe.
He failed in an attempt to kidnap his own daughter, and eventually he convinced his wife to return home.
At age 65 he retired.
On the 1st day of retirement he received a cheque from the Government for $105.
He felt that the Government was saying that he couldn‚Äôt provide for himself.
He decided to commit suicide, it wasn‚Äôt worth living anymore; he had failed so much.
He sat under a tree writing his will, but instead, he wrote what he would have accomplished with his life. He realised there was much more that he hadn‚Äôt done. There was one thing he could do better than anyone he knew. And that was how to cook.
So he borrowed $87 against his cheque and bought and fried up some chicken using his recipe, and went door to door to sell them to his neighbours in Kentucky.
Remember at age 65 he was ready to commit suicide.
But at age 88 Colonel Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) Empire was a billionaire.
Moral of the story: Attitude. It's never too late to start all over.
MOST IMPORTANLY, IT'S ALL ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE. NEVER GIVE UP NO MATTER HOW HARD IT GETS.
You have what it takes to be successful. Go for it and make a difference. No guts no glory. It's never too old to dream.

Suddenly it started raining & both got wet.


They found an empty hut & went inside.

Girl was luking awesome in her wet white T-shirt & denim shorts.

The boy came close to her & wrapped his arms around her waist.

He caught her close & put his hand on her wet waist.

Girl put her hands on boy's shoulder & offered her lips for a kiss.

6/25/16, 5:09 PM - Satish: Cameron needs to immediately apply for Britain to become a Union Territory of the Republic of India. 

Whilst historically speaking it seems only right and proper to give India a chance to rule Britain for a few hundred years - it actually makes a lot of sense for the British too!

Worried about jobs? India‚Äôs economy is growing 4x faster than Europe‚Äôs and will overtake the entire EU‚Äôs sometime in the 2030s - becoming twice the size of the EU economy by 2050.

In economic terms alone every young Brit should wish to replace their garish red EU passport with a classy blue Indian one ASAP.

Worried about the future of the NHS? India already provides nearly as many Doctors to the NHS as the EU does - and that doesn‚Äôt even include those of Indian origin, born or educated, in Britain. 25,055 Indian v 30,082 EU.

Worried about diversity? With over 100 different languages spoken everyday and adherents of every religion - even Britain‚Äôs favourite materialist consumption - there truly is something for everyone here!

Worried about being understood? English is one of India's two official languages - which will be a huge relief for all those have struggled to communicate with their continental neighbours for all these years.

Worried about not being part of something bigger? India has more than twice the population of the EU. Half of which are under 35, so the bonus is no more worries about an ageing population!

Worried about where to go on holiday? The Himalayas are nearly three times the height of the Alps and thousands of miles longer - there are more sandy beaches along India‚Äôs coastline than all the Costas you can dream of - and India has tropical rainforests and even a desert too! Plenty of visa free inter-railing adventures as well on the world‚Äôs largest railway network. 

Worried about not being ruled by an unlected bureaucracy in a far away land? We‚Äôve got that covered as well! Nowhere on the planet has perfected the shuffling of paper and writing of rules better than New Delhi - what‚Äôs more India‚Äôs civil servants salaries are more than 10x lower than Brussels. Talk about getting more for less!

British MPs, the whole of Whitehall and even the Royal Family (subject to the return of the Kohinor) can all be pensioned off at the fast expanding and internationally renowned Best Exotic Marigold Hotel chain in Jaipur.

Which would free up the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and much of Central London to become a permanent Bollywood film set. With more viewers than Hollywood this is sure to help keep London‚Äôs tourist economy going - which within a decade or two will be mostly Indians in any case.

Embrace the 21st Century. Swap Brussels for Delhi. Say Goodbye to Little Europe and Namaste to Incredible India!

Yours in waiting,

7/1/16, 2:13 PM - Kashif: boss yeh Kya ho raha hain. Abb toh RSS bhi topi pahenne lagi. Pseudo secularism ke khilaaf abb awaaz kaun uthayega
7/1/16, 2:19 PM - Maaruti: I will give you news from slightly more credible source than Scroll 
http://m.thehindu.com/news/national/we-are-not-hosting-any-iftar-party-says-rss/article8793227.ece
7/1/16, 2:29 PM - Kashif: But what about the picture. Is that photoshopped
7/1/16, 2:31 PM - Maaruti: No Picture is not photoshopped
7/1/16, 2:31 PM - Maaruti: This is BJP

7/1/16, 2:51 PM - Ashutosh: Thanks Arvind !!!!
7/1/16, 3:12 PM - ANUPAM: Let us look at scroll.in article, writer makes third class unsubstantiated claims..
7/1/16, 3:12 PM - ANUPAM: But here's the conundrum: what if the state has given up on being secular? In a post-Modi era, when the Indian state is moving towards endorsing Hindu symbols, Hindu theological laws and religious worship-as-a-political-event, even the tokenism of the iftar party could maybe be a good thing, balancing out majoritarianism that lurks beneath the surface
7/1/16, 3:13 PM - ANUPAM: Can writer give any evidence of state moving towards theological laws and religious worship ya Aise hi chutiyapa
7/1/16, 3:13 PM - ANUPAM: While measures like debarring Muslims and Christians from Dalit reservations meant the Congress did plenty to encourage Hindu chauvinists,¬†
7/1/16, 3:18 PM - ANUPAM: So article wants to say that religious reservations are OK..is he even aware supreme court has repeatedly banned those
7/1/16, 3:18 PM - ANUPAM: After his 2014 election win, for example, Narendra Modi¬†performed¬†a religious ceremony in Banaras and ensured that it was telecast live on televisio
7/1/16, 3:19 PM - ANUPAM: Is writer even aware that pope mass was and is televised live routinely on DD
7/1/16, 3:20 PM - ANUPAM: The open use of religious worship as a tool of political propaganda by a person no less than the prime minister is alarming
7/1/16, 3:21 PM - ANUPAM: Means PM has no right to practice his religion..wow in US and UK presidents and pm have openly given statements regarding Christian affiliation

7/1/16, 4:37 PM - Maaruti: lol
7/1/16, 5:10 PM - Kashif: My point was : when BJP/RSS were in opposition they made such hue and cry over these events and projected themselves as holier than thou. But now they are doing the same thing.
7/1/16, 5:12 PM - Kashif: Anupam your analogy of comparing Pope with PM of a democratic country is wrong. While the Pope is a religious leader , the PM is a head of a state . In a democratic country there should be separation of state and religion.
7/1/16, 5:12 PM - Maaruti: Ok Ok
7/1/16, 5:13 PM - Maaruti: Let's celebrate ThanksGiving speech
7/1/16, 5:14 PM - Kashif: With regards to "tokenism": isn't BJP pandering to vote bank poliics

7/1/16, 5:15 PM - Satish: Muslim inclusion is emphasised
7/1/16, 5:16 PM - Maaruti: Muslims should make it sure they are included
7/1/16, 5:16 PM - Kashif: And with regards to "topi": from what I have read in historical and other religious description of Prophet Mohammed . He himself never wore it.
7/1/16, 5:16 PM - Satish: And most important a Teli is PM
7/1/16, 5:16 PM - ANUPAM: BJP doing it doesn't make it right..in fact perverse
7/1/16, 5:16 PM - Maaruti: It's not BJP 's imeperative
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Kashif: So I don't know where this symbol of topi and that chequered gamjha became a symbol of Muslim
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - ANUPAM: A state must never engage in religious shows..never
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - ANUPAM: Arab symbols
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Maaruti: From Arab
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Satish: A religion should never influence a state
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Kashif: Arabs don't wear topi.
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Satish: Else you become middle east
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Maaruti: Sir that's a very small part
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - ANUPAM: What starts as religious tokenism.. it becomes a landmine
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Kashif: Anupam i agree with you
7/1/16, 5:17 PM - Satish: Arab only wear condom
7/1/16, 5:18 PM - Kashif: Hahaha

7/1/16, 5:18 PM - Satish: Haraam
7/1/16, 5:19 PM - Maaruti: I think India is only state where these kind of tokenism is taken/made issue
7/1/16, 5:19 PM - Maaruti: Baki Jagah it really doesn't matter
7/1/16, 5:19 PM - ANUPAM: Either do all festivals together or none of them..
7/1/16, 5:19 PM - Satish: Because baki jagah...except few it's all truly dictatorial regimes
7/1/16, 5:20 PM - Maaruti: Either Holidays for Christmas or nothing
7/1/16, 5:20 PM - Satish: My belief is there should be no public holiday
7/1/16, 5:20 PM - Satish: 50 De do ...

7/1/16, 5:26 PM - Maaruti: Kaha Ki Paisa ka Printing price do
7/1/16, 5:26 PM - ANUPAM: We are talking about specific issue..
1. State should have nothing do with religion
Ergo
2. Hindu temples should be rescued from state control
3. State must never sponsor kumbh festival or haj..all religious bodies should be asked to sponsor on their own
4. minority institutions should be NOT exempt from laws of state
7/1/16, 5:26 PM - Maaruti: State doesn't sponsore Khumbh
7/1/16, 5:26 PM - ANUPAM: It organises
7/1/16, 5:26 PM - ANUPAM: Money is spent? Who pays ?
7/1/16, 5:27 PM - Maaruti: Will check that now
7/1/16, 5:28 PM - ANUPAM: Similarly for kailash mansarovar ..

Hindu temples should be made autonomous and they can use it to avail services of professionals..
7/1/16, 5:29 PM - ANUPAM: Currently state controls Hindu temples and you have atrocious management..riots..no contribution to education,health etc..
7/1/16, 5:29 PM - ANUPAM: Ask It aloud where does money go ??
7/1/16, 5:31 PM - Maaruti: Checked it
7/1/16, 5:31 PM - Maaruti: 1200 Crore was the budget

7/1/16, 6:03 PM - ANUPAM: Government should not enforce uniform civil code on those who Dont want it..let it remain forever as testimony to hypocrisy of seculars/liberals in India..
7/1/16, 6:05 PM - ANUPAM: In any case why is BJP/HIndus excited about it..that Muslim personal law board would be humiliated..what is benefit in that ?
7/1/16, 6:05 PM - ANUPAM: Remember Hindu mahasabha and Jan sangh posed created opposition to Hindu code bill..why are they pushing it on Muslims..
7/1/16, 6:08 PM - Maaruti: UCC is must for simple reason that It is thought to come handy to preserve Hinduism
7/1/16, 6:08 PM - Kashif: There should be uniform civil code in a democratic society
7/1/16, 6:09 PM - Kashif: Maruti Hinduism does not need a law to preserve it. It is much stronger than you think

7/1/16, 6:28 PM - ANUPAM: Have seen many missionaries convert /attract by offering health/education benefits
7/1/16, 6:29 PM - ANUPAM: All Muslims and Christians must be free to proselytize but then so should be hindus
7/1/16, 6:29 PM - ANUPAM: Why should we ask for restricting them ?..that's a negative way of thinking about it..why not ask for parity
7/1/16, 6:30 PM - ANUPAM: Ultimately if anything offers quality it will triumph..its all competition.. Free market

7/1/16, 6:36 PM - Maaruti: Kamai ka Jariya hai
7/1/16, 6:40 PM - ANUPAM: Kisi aur tarah se kama le..why using my religion for it ..so there..Hindus can preserve Hinduism themselves..state needs to keep their hands off..
7/1/16, 6:41 PM - ANUPAM: If you let state govern ..people like Azam khan will head kumbh mela as happened
7/1/16, 6:42 PM - ANUPAM: http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-policy-watch-govt-control-not-the-best-way-to-manage-temple-trusts-1876444
7/1/16, 6:43 PM - ANUPAM: Sounds far-fetched? Consider this. The only two religions that can boast of not having beggars on the streets of India are the Sikhs and the Parsis. One would have thought that the majority would take the lead, but it hasn‚Äôt.

Then, take the best of educational institutions. Outside IITs, the IIS and IIMs which are created under special Acts of Parliament ‚Äì hence are relatively autonomous ‚Äì the names that come to mind are St Xavier‚Äôs, St Stephens, CMC Vellore, Bombay Scottish, JB Petit, and Vachha Wadia. Not a single educational institution belongs to the majority community. The Banaras Hindu University and the educational institutions run by the Tirumala trusts around Tirupati have been allowed to decline in rankings.

Why? One answer is the majority community institutions have been left with little or no protection. They are open to rapacious moves by the political class ‚Äì irrespective of party. They have been thwarted in their efforts to develop their own standards of excellence and reinforce their respective value systems.

Take, for instance, the manner in¬†
7/1/16, 6:44 PM - ANUPAM: Take, for instance, the manner in which all cash-rich temple trusts in India are now controlled by the government (see table). It started with the Tirumala Trusts when NT Rama Rao, the erstwhile chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, began eyeing the trust funds, and passed a law to control them primarily for financing his politically motivated largesse.

It wasn‚Äôt long before that all temple trusts belonging to the majority community were ‚Äònationalised‚Äô. The strategy was invariably the same: level charges of corruption; supersede the trust; appoint government nominees; and control the way ‚Äòdonations‚Äô are spent.

The temptation to control these trusts is obvious. There is both money and power ‚Äî a heady combination.

This has serious implications. For instance, notwithstanding tax regulations which stipulate that 85% of the collections be spent on charity, the government of Maharashtra has informed the Siddhivinayak Trust not to spend over 15%. The Shirdi Trust has been asked to finance the building of an airport, a move that is being challenged in courts. And the cluster of colleges and schools around Tirupati that used to impart the best of education in the region, have now slipped into mediocrity.

When a community is prevented from using its religious funds to promote the values and institutions meant for the benefit of that community, it is deprived of the very means for rejuvenation. After all, politicians have a five-year vision, punctuated by elections.

7/2/16, 5:17 PM - Maaruti: People are protesting against 7PC
7/2/16, 5:17 PM - Maaruti: Sir 6 PC supposed to be given by 2006 was given in 2008/9
7/2/16, 5:18 PM - ANUPAM: Not much increase..or at least as much as expected..which is a good thing by the way
7/2/16, 5:18 PM - ANUPAM: We are not growing that much as to warrant a good increase
7/2/16, 5:19 PM - Maaruti: So a simple calculation of addition of inflation and bank interest should be taken when first salary was released should be taken into consideration.
7/2/16, 5:19 PM - ANUPAM: In government at lower echelons pay higher..in higher echelons pay much much higher in corporate

.it figures at number 4 or 5 now in India even in recession times..at times we were preparing,it was in top 3..
7/2/16, 5:35 PM - ANUPAM: Reason cost of study( mafia in medical education), limited seats( in govt med college) and longer duration of training 30 years..vis a vis pay offs
7/2/16, 5:35 PM - ANUPAM: Each profession has a different dynamics of salary..
7/2/16, 5:36 PM - Satish: I disagree...In Delhi it will be in top 2

7/2/16, 6:57 PM - ANUPAM: Why are general category people obsessed with government is what I am amused at, the system is tuned in such a way that natural outcome,when it is at its most efficient is like Tamil nadu..

7/2/16, 7:04 PM - ANUPAM: So basically only 42 out of 673 open seats , occupied by so called general category..

The message for so called well off people or general category people is if you can't leave India, then remain here and do two things..

1. Educate your children in private schools,get private health care, private roads like gurgaon..

2. create private networks 
We know Indian private sector is full of networking..

Favor your friends in private sector ,create lasting terms and they will lead to employment of your children..

7/2/16, 7:11 PM - ANUPAM: If anyone thinks putting brahmin,bania out of 5% government jobs/education jobs like they have done in politics will fetch them rewards..then remember they will capture 95% of jobs education which are in private sector..
7/2/16, 7:13 PM - ANUPAM: Saare IBM/TCS/Infosys/reddy me dukaan banaayenge..baaki sab marks ka Rona royenge

7/3/16, 8:58 AM - ANUPAM: <Media omitted>
7/3/16, 8:59 AM - Maaruti: Mujhe Bhi chahiye
7/3/16, 8:59 AM - Maaruti: üòäüòäüòä
7/3/16, 8:59 AM - ANUPAM: But problem was it cost 6 lakhs..and didn't sell a lot..so cost is cheaper..

7/3/16, 9:02 AM - ANUPAM: I did it on myself ..üòã.pratyush sells those..ask him..made a video..now lost..
7/3/16, 9:03 AM - ANUPAM: We can make a cheaper version..you can plug with any android tablet
7/3/16, 9:04 AM - ANUPAM: https://prehospitalmed.com/2012/06/18/the-search-for-the-sub-100-videolaryngoscope/
7/3/16, 9:04 AM - ANUPAM: Vision are somewhat too radical a departure from their traditional direct laryngoscopy skills to be taken up enthusiastically.

Now there are video laryngoscopes on the market currently that offer traditional style Macintosh blade designs. The most popular systems would be the CMAC ( Karl Storz) and McGrath. Glidescope system does not have a truly Macintosh style blade. NONE OF THEM COST LESS THAN $2000 AU, let alone $100.

SO WHAT TO DO?

Build it yourself? Why not?

What do you need?

1.Macintosh blade laryngoscope #4, disposable. I chose the¬†Trulite version, fully disposable, $16.

2.USB waterproof endoscope, $27.

3. Windows or Apple OS laptop/tablet with USB port, use¬†Vividtrac imaging software¬†to display USB camera image

TOTAL COST (exc laptop) = $42
7/3/16, 9:06 AM - ANUPAM: I have plugged this system with nexus 7 tablet..works as well..cheap and good..

So why won't companies/hospitals buy it..

Because there is a scam /understanding in medical fraternity to keep costs inflated
7/3/16, 9:08 AM - ANUPAM: You know why pocket ultrasound devices didn't pick up in USA..because reimbursements for standard echo lost..loss of $500-1000 ..

7/3/16, 9:14 AM - Satish: 420üòù
7/3/16, 9:16 AM - ANUPAM: Why would I buy a 420 dollars video laryngoscope when I do direct laryngoscopies for free..its an adjunct ( teaching/assisted)..
7/3/16, 9:17 AM - ANUPAM: Ask pratyush.even he has difficulty selling Karl stortz video laryngoscope with perverse incentives
7/3/16, 9:17 AM - Satish: Because your frnd works in karl
7/3/16, 9:18 AM - ANUPAM: Can we con modi in producing video laryngoscope under made in India. üòã
7/3/16, 9:19 AM - Maaruti: Or bronchoscope
7/3/16, 9:19 AM - ANUPAM: Its a simple proof of concept endoscope..

Just plugging a borescope(2-3000 rupees) to laryngoscope,and an android tab
7/3/16, 9:19 AM - ANUPAM: No flexible bronchoscope is tough,

Doctors who¬†received a meal focused on Crestor four or more times prescribed it 1.8 times as¬†frequently as¬†doctors who received no meals. For a high-blood-pressure drug¬†called Bystolic, those who received a single meal prescribed it at twice the rate¬†of those who received no meals.
7/3/16, 12:44 PM - ANUPAM: If you went in there with cash, and you said to the doctor, 'I‚Äôll give you $7 to prescribe more Crestor,' they would be offended and wouldn‚Äôt talk to you," Dudley said. "But if you go in there with some doughnuts and the nurse¬†says to the doctor, 'There are crullers in the conference room,' the doctor goes in there of their own free will.¬†Humans, when they receive gifts, feel some urge to reciprocity. They‚Äôre willing to then listen to you."

7/3/16, 2:05 PM - ANUPAM: He was the avatar of Vishnu but a disciple of Shiva...
And He shall be the martial guru of Kalki, the last Avatar in this Yuga!
When the Chandravanshi emperor Arjun began expanding his empire to the entire world, the Asuras hit back with an insidious plan. Caught in the crossfire is Raam, who comes back from his penance tofind 21 arrows piercing his father's body. Raam vows to avenge his death by killing the evil Kshatriyas 21 times starting with Arjun.
Thus begins The Legend of Parshuram.

Priest: "Sending her body home would cost you $10000.... but... burial here at this holy city would cost just $100".

Man:"I'll take the body home!!!"

Priest:"Why the costly option? You must really love your wife a lot"

Man: "Nothing like that Father.. Just that Jesus was buried here and came alive on the 3rd day...

why risk......!!!

Yes, and I will repeat it..

Shri Ram College of Commerce, under Delhi University (DU), is a premier institution run by a trust whose founder Shriram Lala was a Hindu. This puts the institution in a non-minority legal category. The college is aided 95 percent by the Central government.

7/8/16, 9:15 AM - Chaurasia New: It sells very well
7/8/16, 9:15 AM - Satish: Nahi hoti kya?????

7/8/16, 9:21 AM - Satish: What kind of argument is this
7/8/16, 9:21 AM - ANUPAM: True,..you are right satish..

In that case,every institute should follow policy of bsc computer honours course..
7/8/16, 9:21 AM - Satish: Yes..They must
7/8/16, 9:22 AM - ANUPAM: But then parents will cry,why another exam..
7/8/16, 9:22 AM - ANUPAM: Because ,12th exam has become shit with grade inflation and distortion by state boards
7/8/16, 9:23 AM - ANUPAM: 10% children have ten CGPA..fuck..
7/8/16, 9:24 AM - ANUPAM: Here are some facts.

In 2014, in Tamil Nadu medical admission test, 132 students were tied at 100 percent, 292 at 99.875 percent, 218 at 99.750 percent and so on. This happens every year.

7/8/16, 9:26 AM - Chaurasia New: Hum to kahten hai Satish ko AMU bheja, thesis karne ke ki liye
7/8/16, 9:26 AM - Chaurasia New: Every institute should have have hidden jehad wing,b believe me it will make good money
7/8/16, 9:26 AM - Chaurasia New: Don't miss qoute me, jehad means dharam youdh üòÇüòÇüòÇ
7/8/16, 9:27 AM - Chaurasia New: Ok

7/8/16, 9:28 AM - Chaurasia New: Seeing is believing
7/8/16, 9:28 AM - Satish: Amu should be treated with Tankers
7/8/16, 9:29 AM - Satish: The way Indira Gandhi did  with Bhindrawaly
7/8/16, 9:29 AM - Chaurasia New: Impressed dr Satish, salutes
7/8/16, 9:29 AM - Satish: But making Hindus behave like others is a bad idea
7/8/16, 9:29 AM - Chaurasia New: Again impressed
7/8/16, 9:29 AM - Satish: I have told this many times Arvind
7/8/16, 9:30 AM - Satish: We should not degrade ourselves just because others went low
7/8/16, 9:32 AM - ANUPAM: We should not hit back, because others hit sounds good in theory,bad in practical- with a bully.
7/8/16, 9:33 AM - Satish: It's not about hitting
7/8/16, 9:33 AM - Satish: It's about radical thoughts
7/8/16, 9:33 AM - ANUPAM: Now, unfortunately laws are communal, I can say that this will lead to communal backlash
7/8/16, 9:34 AM - ANUPAM: Eg. I am sure funny DU laws if admission in SRCC will lead to backlash against Tamil nadu
7/8/16, 9:34 AM - ANUPAM: No doubt in my mind
7/8/16, 9:34 AM - Chaurasia New: How many times have u seen or heard a Hindu slashing a human neck on the name of Allah, and how many times a Muslim doing so,,

My only question is why is that difference
7/8/16, 9:34 AM - Chaurasia New: Degrade karne ke liye kuch bachega tab to
7/8/16, 9:35 AM - ANUPAM: My only point we should try to remove any unfair advantage on basis if region,religion and caste( as much as is realistically possible )
7/8/16, 9:35 AM - Maaruti: Yes
7/8/16, 9:36 AM - Maaruti: Jab tak Aapko apni Galti ka ehsaas hoga tab tak Aap bachiyega hi Nahi
7/8/16, 9:36 AM - Satish: Kaali ma. .Parshuraamm
7/8/16, 9:36 AM - ANUPAM: And never,ever refuse to debate it in name of being communal/elitist as our third grade liberals do
7/8/16, 9:36 AM - Satish: Bali Partha  is common
7/8/16, 9:36 AM - Satish: Good thing Hindus reformed and many converted to Nariyal bali
7/8/16, 9:37 AM - Maaruti: Narbali ??
7/8/16, 9:37 AM - ANUPAM: Religion is defined by current deeds of its followers rather than what is written in text/practised in past..
7/8/16, 9:37 AM - Satish: Bhai I accept liberals are 3rd grade and communals are first grade
7/8/16, 9:38 AM - ANUPAM: Communal are not first grade..but to not debate it is shit
7/8/16, 9:38 AM - Satish: Nariyal phodthe nahi Ho. .Chinmastika mein
7/8/16, 9:38 AM - Satish: Yes debate must be there
7/8/16, 9:39 AM - ANUPAM: So mention revoking pseudo- minority status for AMU, of ghar waapsi and see how much our liberal media starts dancing
7/8/16, 9:39 AM - Satish: I completely  agree...old text books may be irrelevant in current context...I always say to Muslims that their religion need reforms much more than others
7/8/16, 9:39 AM - Maaruti: How is Killing for food and killing in name of religion different ?
7/8/16, 9:39 AM - ANUPAM: This..is blatant hypocrisy
7/8/16, 9:40 AM - Satish: Killing for food is survival and need based...Killing for god is fear bassd
7/8/16, 9:40 AM - Satish: Based
7/8/16, 9:40 AM - Maaruti: Ok Mindless killing I agree can be condemned
7/8/16, 9:40 AM - Maaruti: No
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Satish: Yes...Killing is biggest sin
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Maaruti: Killing for Religion is also food based
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Maaruti: Just that you give them a touch of divinity
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Satish: Yes üòä...Bhagwaan se jaada paapi bhog lagate hain
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Chaurasia New: Ok one or two ,aur ab
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Maaruti: That you are thankful to almighty for it
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Chaurasia New: Aur sir aap Jo ho raha hai uske baare mein bhi to boliye
7/8/16, 9:41 AM - Chaurasia New: Tumne dekha hai ???
7/8/16, 9:43 AM - ANUPAM: In any case..now I have participated in so many debates and now I have come to conclusion , haters will remain haters 90% of times

So best thing to do is push your point of view/propaganda..
Try to win argument..

Trying to convince other on opposite side 10% is too much of an effort..
Be interested to win
7/8/16, 9:43 AM - ANUPAM: More efficient

7/8/16, 9:55 AM - Satish: But don't understand Anupam source of hatred...
7/8/16, 9:55 AM - Satish: Or conflict I will put
7/8/16, 9:56 AM - Maaruti: First Of all Sir , I work in A Muslim Country and As I have told you that a Muslim Rickshwala dropped me to my home in Bhagalpur Riot , so there is no hard feeling against Muslim .
7/8/16, 9:57 AM - Satish: I agree but inside frustrations may be there for some reasons..their unholy alliance with Yadavs
7/8/16, 9:57 AM - Satish: Or Radical conversions they do
7/8/16, 9:57 AM - Satish: Or preachings on youtube
7/8/16, 9:57 AM - Satish: I do understand your feelings
7/8/16, 9:58 AM - Satish: But I want to know how Anupam is getting into that trap slowly...
7/8/16, 9:58 AM - Maaruti: Secondly when you make it this simplistic its again wrong .
7/8/16, 9:58 AM - Satish: Okay I am wronh
7/8/16, 10:00 AM - Maaruti: When you say you haven't experienced Sanatan or something like that it's equally ridiculous
7/8/16, 10:00 AM - Satish: Arey bhai I agree I am ridiculous
7/8/16, 10:00 AM - Chaurasia New: <Media omitted>
7/8/16, 10:00 AM - Satish: It's not about me
7/8/16, 10:01 AM - Maaruti: I am sure you must be believing in Divinity
7/8/16, 10:01 AM - Satish: Yes I do...
7/8/16, 10:01 AM - Satish: God is supreme
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Satish: Preachers are not
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Maaruti: And The fact that Divinity can be attained by following the Righteous path
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Maaruti: So that's Sanatan
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Satish: I know what is Santaan
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Satish: I said I have not closely followed it's principles
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Maaruti: So where is this conflict !
7/8/16, 10:02 AM - Satish: So can't speak on it
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Maaruti: No one can
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Maaruti: That's why we are not divine
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Satish: From Government to Santaan
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Satish: We are debating here Government partisan roles
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Maaruti: Yes
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Satish: Which I condemned
7/8/16, 10:03 AM - Satish: I said all institutions should conduct entrance
7/8/16, 10:04 AM - Maaruti: Govt partisan role because we are led by slaves whom we made hero
7/8/16, 10:04 AM - Maaruti: And ??
7/8/16, 10:04 AM - Satish: Sacrifice is wrong ...Whether Bakra  for allah or Bali for parshuraam
7/8/16, 10:04 AM - Maaruti: Sir you missed one very vital point in that question
7/8/16, 10:04 AM - Satish: Who is slave hero
7/8/16, 10:04 AM - Maaruti: The word was 'Human'
7/8/16, 10:05 AM - Maaruti: Slaves like Romila Thapar
7/8/16, 10:05 AM - Maaruti: Or may be Ram Guha
7/8/16, 10:05 AM - Maaruti: Who wrote our history books
7/8/16, 10:05 AM - Satish: Human Sacrifice is sin
7/8/16, 10:05 AM - Maaruti: Yes
7/8/16, 10:06 AM - Maaruti: When you shout Allah ho Akbar before detonating a Fidayeen
7/8/16, 10:06 AM - Satish: Absolute sin..no one can forgive ...If God is there or you may worshipping Devil
7/8/16, 10:06 AM - Maaruti: I mean Human Bomb that needs to looked into what drove him to that point
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - ANUPAM: Don't worry about me..I am tired of seeing communal laws all around me and faux liberals keeping quiet and say don't discuss, it will hurt other person's feelings
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - Satish: Talented preachers like you Maruti...
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - Maaruti: That he finds that absolute despicable act into feeling of righteous
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - Satish: Who don't discuss..
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - Maaruti: Yes
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - vishalsatish: Bas kar bhai
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - ANUPAM: These communal and casteist laws will ..create lasting backlash
7/8/16, 10:07 AM - Satish: We must discuss ...condemn and support uniform laws for citizens
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Satish: I always said that. ..and you know it pom very well
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Maaruti: Uniform Law
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Maaruti: ??
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Maaruti: Yaha to Communal Violence law hai
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Maaruti: Absolutely making it clear
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Satish: Yes...Castiest laws and caste system should be abloshied
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Maaruti: In case of Riot , it's Hinidus Fault
7/8/16, 10:08 AM - Satish: Government should incentiveise intercaste marriage
7/8/16, 10:09 AM - Satish: And revoke favourable laws
7/8/16, 10:09 AM - Maaruti: And Muslims will go Scot free for charges like Murder or Rape
7/8/16, 10:09 AM - ANUPAM: 1. Codified laws which doesn't discriminate on religion,region
2. No one( group) can take law into hands..

That is beginning of civil society

7/8/16, 10:21 AM - ANUPAM: Do you know satish..one of the first things UPA did after coming to power in 2004 ..was to bring a constitutional amendment to bypass 13 judge bench supreme court judgement, to favour minorities..
Did you even hear a liberal backlash,any mainstream liberal media commentary..that is how compromised media/Indian liberals are
7/8/16, 10:23 AM - ANUPAM: Think of it communal constitutional amendments have been carried out to overturn shah bano and against TMA pai..and here we are talking about ideal things..

7/8/16, 10:26 AM - Kashif: Listening to maruti, Arvind and now anupam I am starting to believe that the minorities in india are having golden age. They have the best schools, colleges and get the best jobs. Wish I had stayed in india to see the golden age
7/8/16, 10:26 AM - Kashif: I believe the solution is simple: have entrance test nation wide
7/8/16, 10:27 AM - Kashif: For all colleges
7/8/16, 10:27 AM - ANUPAM: No kashif..rule of law has no meaning in India..it is not enforced..that is why minorities suffer
7/8/16, 10:27 AM - ANUPAM: Togadia gets away and owaisi goes in jail
7/8/16, 10:27 AM - Kashif: And allocate colleges as per rank. If it can be done for engg and medical college then why not for others
7/8/16, 10:27 AM - ANUPAM: But solution is not making communal laws
7/8/16, 10:28 AM - Maaruti: That enterance is Boards
7/8/16, 10:28 AM - Kashif: I agree and that's why I say uniform civil code in a democratic society
7/8/16, 10:28 AM - Kashif: Maruti boards of state and CBSE are not same level

7/9/16, 10:18 AM - Satish: Yes laws must be uniform
7/9/16, 10:19 AM - ANUPAM: In India voting is for party which can get exemption for a group based on caste/religion

7/9/16, 10:21 AM - ANUPAM: Eg. In UP election let's say there are two candidates in mla election, a kurmi from SP and a yadav from BJP..

A yadav will still vote for kurmi SP candidate because SP will fix all yadav in school,police by bending laws
7/9/16, 10:22 AM - ANUPAM: So people Dont vote for caste, they vote for party who gives special advantages for caste
7/9/16, 10:24 AM - ANUPAM: I never thought this case..but apart from corruption congress under Sonia Gandhi became anti Hindu party..passed so many communal laws..93rd amendment,Right to education, brought communal violence bill..which was so anti majority
7/9/16, 10:26 AM - ANUPAM: People think it doesn't matter..because liberal media doesn't report..but remember such laws will create massive backlash..

7/9/16, 10:35 AM - ANUPAM: Both are important..
Eg. Think arun shourie. 
He might have left BJP,turned renegade, but he turned so many neutral successful persons to other ( right) side..these all successful people created a chain reaction as their circle of influence was big
7/9/16, 10:36 AM - Satish: I believe so
7/9/16, 10:37 AM - ANUPAM: In a rule of law( developed) society and in town,where no party gurantees group based benefits, the propagandist has an unfair advantage
7/9/16, 10:37 AM - Maaruti: Sir the advantage of SM is its in direct open conflict with MSM and it's a positive thing
7/9/16, 10:37 AM - Maaruti: Now Media is not exactly a narrative that Some people wanted to propagate
7/9/16, 10:38 AM - ANUPAM: Think how ravish, ashustosh,pp bajpayee sitting in news channels changed so many opinions inAAP's favour..till their conflict of interest was exposed
7/9/16, 10:38 AM - Maaruti: Now we have cheer girls even for those cheer boys
7/9/16, 10:39 AM - Maaruti: Sir Jooth ka kooch din to Raj Chalega hi Na
7/9/16, 10:39 AM - Maaruti: But at the end it falls flat
7/9/16, 10:39 AM - ANUPAM: In particular ravish, who writes so many open letters to right wing journalists, has never even one open letter to barkha,ashutosh,bajpayee
7/9/16, 10:39 AM - Maaruti: Eventually And Inevitably
7/9/16, 10:40 AM - Maaruti: Because he knows they are same team
7/9/16, 10:40 AM - Maaruti: Apne Ko Run out Kara Ke Kaun Se match jeet lenge
7/9/16, 10:40 AM - Maaruti: Bowling to Saamne wali team Ke against karna hai Na
7/9/16, 10:40 AM - ANUPAM: The person who mixes truth and untruth and is very polite is far far more insidious and harmful than a blatantly opposed persin
7/9/16, 10:41 AM - ANUPAM: Ravish projected himself as neutral, till he was found out..far more dangerous than sagarika,Sudhir chaudhary
7/9/16, 10:42 AM - Maaruti: Yes but it usually for those person who can't see the Truth behind those veiled False
7/9/16, 10:43 AM - ANUPAM: It took people time..till social media wasn't big..people didn't know.that is why these guys hate social media
7/9/16, 10:43 AM - Maaruti: Yes
7/9/16, 10:44 AM - Maaruti: I agree , SM although has got real time wasting techniques it empower many people in so many ways
7/9/16, 10:45 AM - Maaruti: And Atleast MSM ka to Jad hi Khod Ke Kachra Kar diya hai
7/9/16, 10:46 AM - Maaruti: And I still believe irrespective of side , only 3rd grade people with very low Moral values become Journalist
7/9/16, 10:47 AM - Maaruti: SM is Iconoclastic
7/9/16, 10:48 AM - Maaruti: After this MSM , I am sure religion would be the next target
7/9/16, 11:05 AM - Satish: <Media omitted>
7/9/16, 11:12 AM - ANUPAM: Social media is a knowledge trap - you get involved in gaining knowledge rather than doing things..
Good to step out in a while and DO things
7/9/16, 11:13 AM - Satish: http://www.thebetterindia.com/61086/vithoba-till-land-with-cot-impact/
7/9/16, 11:13 AM - ANUPAM: Having said that in a knowledge economy..if you Dont gain knowledge ..you will be left behind
7/9/16, 11:15 AM - ANUPAM: Do you think an open source electronic medical record system where patient can enter medical records from their mobile phones ( xray, visit notes) has a market ?
7/9/16, 11:16 AM - Satish: It has no market but if you create it on its own...It will have advertisements worth million of rupees
7/9/16, 11:17 AM - Satish: So what I meant patient will not pay...but if they subscribe  you will get lot of advertisiments
7/9/16, 11:17 AM - Satish: For more...call me on 9999984509

7/9/16, 12:08 PM - ANUPAM: <Media omitted>
7/9/16, 12:11 PM - ANUPAM: People often say, why is majority unduly worried about minority..
Remember that in India only two secessionist major movements have occurred..one in Punjab and other in kashmir..

I know it is not politically correct, but this is what it is..

In poor countries my friends, your demography is your destiny
7/9/16, 12:13 PM - ANUPAM: BSP forged coalition between dalits and brahmins..dalits realized brahmins of this age are not as much exploiters as dabang OBCs..

7/9/16, 12:18 PM - ANUPAM: Read it very very good article
7/9/16, 12:22 PM - Satish: I believe Brahmins were never exploiters
7/9/16, 12:22 PM - Satish: They were facilitators of Kings Zamindars
7/9/16, 12:23 PM - Satish: Also Brahmins always aligned with Power
7/9/16, 12:23 PM - Satish: Earlier with Congress ...Now Bjp
7/9/16, 12:23 PM - Satish: Intermittently in states with Regional Groups
7/9/16, 12:24 PM - Satish: Real explotation was by Land owners and Money lenders
7/9/16, 12:25 PM - Satish: Brahmins mostly supported them rather stopping them in name of religion...
7/9/16, 12:25 PM - Satish: Check with any Dalit who exploited their family
7/9/16, 12:26 PM - Satish: If there is a story
7/9/16, 12:26 PM - Satish: Villain will be zamindaar or moneylender
7/9/16, 12:26 PM - Satish: Now modern Zamindaar includes thekedaar mall owners shopkeepers...
7/9/16, 12:27 PM - ANUPAM: A person with money is always hero of the story

7/9/16, 12:28 PM - Satish: The one who snatches and distributes is...
7/9/16, 12:28 PM - Satish: So they feel more for veerapan phoolan etc
7/9/16, 12:30 PM - ANUPAM: Ye sab chutiyapa jaldi hi katm hoga, dalits can't ally with OBCs because they suppress maximum in villages..trying to forge union with Muslims with no common meeting ground
7/9/16, 12:31 PM - Satish: They have forged alliance already
7/9/16, 12:31 PM - Satish: Atleast in Delhi
7/9/16, 12:31 PM - Satish: Maharastra

7/9/16, 12:32 PM - ANUPAM: Delhi is a different story, not of caste
7/9/16, 12:32 PM - ANUPAM: Delhi is a city,forget it

7/9/16, 12:32 PM - Satish: I agree

7/9/16, 12:34 PM - Satish: That's there...real issue is leadership
7/9/16, 12:34 PM - ANUPAM: Already maximum representation,can't create subcaste
7/9/16, 12:35 PM - Satish: 15 15 ??
7/9/16, 12:35 PM - ANUPAM: All who talk of dalit Muslim partnership should read about jogendra nath mondal..first law minister of pakistan

7/9/16, 12:38 PM - ANUPAM: Dalits can't convert to Muslim,otherwise they will become OBCs..
Only thing is both are marginalized..but no meeting ground
7/9/16, 12:39 PM - ANUPAM: BJP already had a dalit chief..bangaru laxman..
It has an OBC PM..
Now in few years RSS will have a dalit chief..faster than those chutiyapa communists

7/9/16, 10:59 PM - ANUPAM: Eg. I believe new textile policy and fund infusion is going to favor Muslims most..and that is how it should be done

My daughter-in-law ignored it thinking he was just depressed due to work overload and did not tell us about it,‚Äù he said. Gaurav got married in January, reports Zee News.
7/11/16, 10:01 PM - ANUPAM: Tiwari, who had multiple TV‚Äâshows to his credit, was found lying on his bathroom floor with a thin black line across his neck. The police say that the cause of death was asphyxia, reports The Times of India.

7/11/16, 10:04 PM - ANUPAM: Tiwari lived in a flat in Dwarka's sector 19 with his parents and wife. He fell in the bathroom around 11am on Thursday . Tiwari's father said he was checking his mails at that time while his wife was in the drawing room having coffee.

‚ÄúSuddenly , we heard a loud thud and rushed to the bathroom. My daughter-in-law tried to peep in and found him lying unconscious. We somehow managed to open the door and resuscitate him but he did not respond. He was taken to hospital but did not survive,‚Äú the father said.

The police were subsequently informed and a postmortem conducted. Police found a black line around the neck and said the cause of death was asphyxia. The house and his mobile phone were searched for clues but nothing substantial could be found.

The possibility that he may have fallen on the floor and died, as the family initially suspected, is also being explored. Police are waiting for the full autopsy report.

APPEAL:
Dear Friends, I Just reached from pahalgam after a miserable life from Kashmir, we have started at journey at mid night, the entire roads either full of rocks, trees or broken till 70 kms from pahalgam. They burnt our Langer's, looted the people and even they made them nude, seriously they are not human they behaved like Zombie's. The entire Kashmir community (exceptions are there) i am surprised to see hotelier n Taxi Union hate entire  Indian community, they thrown out our baggages from the hotels, no food, no water even to kids, they have forced people to say Hindustan Murdabad, Pakistan Zindabad. Both Kashmir n Central Govt. Police n CRPF are useless they don't have power to shoot a single bullet that what the people taking benefits, the only solution is Army to save the nation. Have you seen movie Airlift we lived life for 3 days like them, hats off to Langar Walo Ki who feed us otherwise we gave up. We were at base camp but on chargeable basis on high price even we paid for our transport from pahalgam to Delhi or Jammu no help to Srinagar, rescue ke naam pe ghanta, who don't have the money they are still there. Boycott Kashmir Tourism then they get to know the power of Indians, they are least bothered about Tourism, they said we don't want you and your tourism, these are the words from hotel n taxi people. You can't imagine how we spent our 3 days in hell so called Kashmir heaven on earth.

7/16/16, 8:54 AM - ANUPAM: The real reason British quit India was not because of mahatma Gandhi, there were 3 reasons..

A) British became economically weak after world war 2
B) British army had 70% Indians, there was naval mutiny in 1946
C) Britain was far off from India
D) Minor reason.. There was a popular leader in mahatma Gandhi, though he was losing relevance( partition happened under his watch,quit India movement failed)..still over a protracted struggle( he sort of united Indians by strengthening Kashmir)

...None of the conditions are true for Kashmiris.. Hence no freedom..
Tell them you live here but it is not your land. Go to Pakistan if you believe in creation of islamist state..we already had partition on this basis..

And army should f..ck this generation- if it continues to misbehave like it did to previous generation in 90s..
7/16/16, 8:55 AM - Maaruti: Geelani is their Gandhi
7/16/16, 8:55 AM - Maaruti: üåöüåöüåö
7/16/16, 8:56 AM - ANUPAM: I for a moment thought that with recent IAS toppers and so many doctors and engineers working in various parts of India, integration had begun..

7/16/16, 8:56 AM - Maaruti: Wo to aur khatra Ki baat hain

7/16/16, 8:57 AM - ANUPAM: Tibet
7/16/16, 8:57 AM - Maaruti: Saare Ke Saare Truck driver hain
7/16/16, 8:57 AM - Maaruti: Kabhi Bhi Koi Bhi Kahin Bhi Chutiya Jayega
7/16/16, 9:01 AM - ANUPAM: Tell Kashmiris that Indian army bombed Mizoram by aircrafts when there was uprising. Buried khalistanis in multiple graves. Killed naxals in encounters.
Along with encouraging them to become sportsmen and IAS these things should be taught
7/16/16, 9:03 AM - Satish: FUCKED LTTE
7/16/16, 9:04 AM - ANUPAM: Kashmir situation is bad because army and government think pushing money alone works..it is clear once in a while good round of spanking also should be dine
7/16/16, 9:05 AM - ANUPAM: Abhi winter aa jaayega to saare Kashmiri kahwa peeyenge..

7/16/16, 9:18 AM - Satish: Inspite of differences India was ...India is..India will be  always
7/16/16, 9:20 AM - ANUPAM: The reason Pakistan was created that Muslims of UP and Bihar and bengal were taught that they are different.. ( they voted strongly for partition)..Muslims of sindh and Punjab and karnataka did not ..
Tell the Kashmiris to take kashmiriyat and islamistiyat up their asses
7/16/16, 9:21 AM - Satish: What Kashmiryat is ????
7/16/16, 9:21 AM - Satish: To kill minorities and throw them out

7/16/16, 9:24 AM - ANUPAM: The reason I Dont trust media in terms of communal altercation is that they kept quite at kashmiri pandit exodus, just because they thought Muslims in India would be harmed
7/16/16, 9:24 AM - ANUPAM: Quiet
7/16/16, 9:25 AM - ANUPAM: It is like keeping quiet at bihari oppression in Maharashtra for fear of oppression of Marathi in bihar
7/16/16, 9:27 AM - Satish: Media Madarchod
7/16/16, 9:28 AM - ANUPAM: No it is good, but I Dont trust them when they report on caste and religious conflicts..
7/16/16, 9:32 AM - ANUPAM: When you report a victim as of certain caste/religion when he is a minority, while you hide caste/religion when he is a majority..
Then you perpetuate feelings of victimhood in minority
7/16/16, 9:35 AM - Pankaj Jha: What about the opposite: When you report a victim as of certain caste/religion when he is a majority, while you hide caste/religion when he is a minority. Then you perpetuate feelings of chutipanti in majority
7/16/16, 9:36 AM - ANUPAM: That is what I just said..
7/16/16, 9:37 AM - Pankaj Jha: Kashmiriyat is to blackmail both India and Pak And get money from wherever it can come

7/17/16, 9:07 PM - ANUPAM: In Allahabad University, during the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi agitation, I put a simple question to the packed audience consisting of teachers and students, almost equally divided between Hindus and Muslims. ‚ÄúHave the Hindus in this audience ever seen the inside of a Muslim home?‚Äù

One or two murmured ‚Äúmy father knew Persian‚Äù or ‚Äúmy mother cooks chicken‚Äù as evidence of his or her emancipation from religious parochialism. But, no, none of them had ever been to a Muslim home.

Likewise, the Muslims in the gathering had never visited a Hindu home. At that moment, a truth hit me between my eyes. We have lived in a state of un-institutionalized apartheid for decades, even centuries‚Ä¶
7/17/16, 9:08 PM - ANUPAM: The Muslim as the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù hit home particularly hard one day in 1996 when our maid, Ganga, asked my wife to join her in the kitchen to talk about something ‚Äúin private.‚Äù

The Indian cricket team was then in the quarter-finals of the ongoing World Cup. She said, ‚ÄúMy husband and I were watching TV last night and wondered which team you and sahib favoured.‚Äù My wife, a teacher by instinct and profession, patiently explained the story of partition and how there were many more Muslims in India than in Pakistan.

Meanwhile, Rangili, the young girl who helps Ganga, teased Jamil, our driver: ‚ÄúTeri team haar gayi¬†(your team has lost).‚Äù Jamil, never short of words, shot back: ‚ÄúAgar meri team haar gayi, to teri team ka kaptaan¬†Pakistani¬†hai¬†(If it is my team which has lost, then the captain of your team is a Pakistani).‚Äù The Indian cricket team captain at the time was Mohammad Azharuddin. This completely foxed Rangili, who marched off to Ganga‚Äôs quarters complaining that Jamil had described the captain of the victorious Indian team as a Pakistani.

Jamil was in the dock. Ganga, who is a ‚ÄúNepali‚Äù from Darjeeling, embarked on a mock trial of Jamil. Her husband Jagdish joined in.

‚ÄúBut are you not a Muslim?‚Äù Rangili asked cheekily.

‚ÄúYes, but not a Pakistani,‚Äù Jamil replied.

‚ÄúMuslims are Pakistanis,‚Äù Rangili persisted.

‚ÄúAzharuddin is also a Muslim,‚Äù Jamil said.

My wife furnished more data. ‚ÄúAzharuddin, who received an award as captain of the winning team, is a Muslim; Sidhu, the man of the match, is a Sikh; Vinod Kambli, who hit a century in the previous match, is a Christian.‚Äù

Ganga eyed my wife suspiciously, ‚ÄúYou mean the Hindu did nothing?‚Äù

My wife was beginning to lose patience. ‚ÄúAn Indian team is an Indian team. There are no Muslim or Hindu teams in our country,‚Äù she asserted.

Ganga found this illogical. ‚ÄúIf the Pakistani team is a Muslim team, why should the Indian team not be a Hindu team?‚Äù

Ganga‚Äôs logic gave Jamil yet another opening. ‚ÄúIf you want a Hindu team, you cannot have Azharuddin as captain.‚Äù

Jagdish intervened aggressively, ‚ÄúIf having Azharuddin as a captain means that we cannot have a Hindu team, we should not have him as captain.‚Äù This angered Jamil.

‚ÄúWho are you to remove Azharuddin? In fact, you should shut up because you are a Nepali.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut I am a Hindu,‚Äù Jagdish continued.

‚ÄúDoes a Nepali Hindu have more rights in India than an Indian Muslim?‚Äù Jamil asked fuming‚Ä¶

For discussion....a case report    18 yr old girl was admitted in hospital for prolonged fever. Investigations revealed it a case of enteric fever. She was given iv antibiotics for 7 days and was recovered  completely. Before discharge, duty doctor sent her blood sample for ABG , instead of some other patient ,bcoz of same name..... young girl went home without taking  ABG report. After few days i saw it on my table. When i read it, i was completely standstill... she was having severe METABOLIC ALKALOSIS pH 8.5 , Hco3 58 meq.
I tried to find her mobile number and called her back. On repeat ABG ,results were same. Her all other reports were absolutely normal. 
After 6 months she was having the same values. She was referred to AIIMS. 
There also everything was normal except ABG.....
7 years after that incidence, after long long research and heavy discussions with doctors abroad, now I know the reason...
Baby ko base pasand hai....

7/20/16, 6:52 AM - apurvaprakash: Long time ago Britain and France were at war. During one battle, the French captured an English colonel.
They took him to their headquarters, and the French General began to question him.
Finally, as an afterthought, the French General asked, "Why do English Officers wear red coats? Don't you know the red material makes you easier targets for us to shoot at?"
In his bland English way, the officer informed the general that the reason British officers wear a red coats is that, if they are shot, the blood won't show, and the men they are leading won't panic."
And that is why, from that day to this, all Pakistani Army Officers wear yellowish brown pants.

coz 

when the uterus contracts,the gynaecologist relaxes,and

 when the uterus relaxes,the latter contracts (read as gets tense)...

7/27/16, 9:30 AM - Satish: *WHY MEN ARE SO HONEST*
 
If you are female & reading this article then just realize the value of a man; and if male, then feel proud after reading it! 

One day, while a woodcutter was cutting a branch of a tree above a river, his axe fell into the river.

When he cried out, the Lord appeared & asked, *"Why are you crying?"*

The woodcutter replied that his axe has fallen into water & he needed it to make a living.

The Lord went down into the water & reappeared with a *Golden Axe*. "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked. The woodcutter replied: *"No."*

The Lord again went down & came up with a *Silver Axe.* "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked. Again, the woodcutter replied: *"No."*

The Lord went down again & came up with an *Iron Axe*. "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked. The woodcutter replied: *"Yes."* 

The Lord was pleased with the man's honesty & gave him all 3 Axes to keep, & the woodcutter went home happy. 

Some time later the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the riverbank, & his wife fell into the river.

When he cried out, the Lord again appeared & asked him: "Why are you crying?"

*"Oh Lord, my wife has fallen into the water!"*

The Lord went down into the water & came up with *SUNNY LEONE*.

"Is this your wife?" the Lord asked. *"Yes,"* cried the woodcutter.

The Lord was furious. *"You lied!* That is an untruth!" The woodcutter replied, "Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding. You see, if I had said *'NO'* to SUNNY LEONE, you would have come up with *KATRINA*. Then if I said *'NO'* to her, you would have come up with *MY WIFE*. Had I then said *'YES,' you would have given me all 3.*
 Lord, I'm a poor man, & not able to take care of 3 wives, so *THAT'S why I said YES to SUNNY."*

The moral of this story is: Whenever a man lies, it is for a *good & honorable reason & for the benefit of others.* 

That's our story, &
we're sticking to it!

*WE MEN ARE TRULY HONORABLE!*

7/30/16, 10:03 PM - Maaruti: Again you are feigning ignorance
7/30/16, 10:04 PM - Maaruti: It's Islam. Land is just a part of it
7/30/16, 10:04 PM - Satish: May be
7/30/16, 10:04 PM - Satish: Then they should take all Kashmiris without Kashmir
7/30/16, 10:04 PM - Maaruti: No
7/30/16, 10:04 PM - Maaruti: They will push you out of Kashmir and then take Kashmir
7/30/16, 10:05 PM - Maaruti: With your women and children as slaves
7/30/16, 10:05 PM - Satish: Land through Islam
7/30/16, 10:05 PM - Satish: End goal is land not Islam
7/30/16, 10:05 PM - Maaruti: Even in Medieval time poorest Muslims had Hindu slaves in 40s and 50s
7/30/16, 10:05 PM - Satish: If Islam is goal take believers of Islam from so called barbaric land
7/30/16, 10:05 PM - Maaruti: Islam says should do this
7/30/16, 10:06 PM - Maaruti: Gazwa e Hind
7/30/16, 10:06 PM - Satish: Do you believe Indian Muslims are mostly converts
7/30/16, 10:06 PM - Satish: I mean 95 percent
7/30/16, 10:06 PM - Maaruti: Doesn't matter what I believe
7/30/16, 10:07 PM - Maaruti: It's what they believe that matters
7/30/16, 10:07 PM - Satish: They believe Zakir Naik
7/30/16, 10:07 PM - Satish: Tells all...
7/30/16, 10:07 PM - Maaruti: So how do you say that
7/30/16, 10:08 PM - Satish: Zakir Naik make everyone believe on Allah's court
7/30/16, 10:09 PM - Maaruti: Sorry
7/30/16, 10:09 PM - Maaruti: Not believe
7/30/16, 10:09 PM - Satish: And doing Indian court case on Arnab Goswami
7/30/16, 10:09 PM - Maaruti: 50 k is the key
7/30/16, 10:09 PM - Satish: 50k?
7/30/16, 10:10 PM - Maaruti: IRF pays 50 K for everyone to get converted to Islam
7/30/16, 10:11 PM - Maaruti: And why is Anti Ghar Wapsi Gandus quite now
7/30/16, 10:11 PM - Satish: He will be behind bars soon

7/30/16, 10:13 PM - Maaruti: When India becomes Indonesia
7/30/16, 10:13 PM - Maaruti: When Gazwa Hind will be complete
7/30/16, 10:14 PM - Maaruti: Those who leave your faith Death for them
7/30/16, 10:14 PM - ANUPAM: In theory..while all people of book( Christianity,Jews,Muslims) believe that their religion is superior unlike sanatan dharma..
Islam while its three books Quran,sira and hadeeth has extensively documented system of laws..

When Muslim liberals try to argue for reform..they are attacked by quoting those verses..makes it difficult
7/30/16, 10:16 PM - ANUPAM: Indonesia is only nation by the way which explicitly rejected shariah or Islamic laws as basis of constitution after extensive debate despite being a predominantly Muslim mation.. And we should appreciate this
7/30/16, 10:18 PM - Maaruti: Sir 1960-65 they eliminated the ones who were against it
7/30/16, 10:18 PM - Maaruti: Do you want to appreciate that
7/30/16, 10:18 PM - ANUPAM: Indonesia,Kazakhstan, Bangladesh(iffy),turkey(gone case)..
7/30/16, 10:19 PM - ANUPAM: What matters us what is happening today ?
7/30/16, 10:19 PM - Maaruti: How many people were killed in Indonesia in 60s and up until early 90sb
7/30/16, 10:19 PM - ANUPAM: Indonesia has kept Islam out of constitution
7/30/16, 10:19 PM - Maaruti: What was the reason
7/30/16, 10:20 PM - ANUPAM: In every society there will be strains fighting against reform
7/30/16, 10:20 PM - Maaruti: A estimate says as large as WW casualty was there
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - Maaruti: Jakarta / Indonesia Genocide
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - Satish: In absolute agreemeny
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - ANUPAM: Consider in 1950s Rajendra Prasad,Hindu mahasabha and a significant part of RSS were wholly opposed to Hindu code bill or Hindu reform bill
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - Satish: Reforms important for all...Some need it more desperately...
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - ANUPAM: It was laughed off as Hindu Manila bill..
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - Maaruti: Opposing and Killing are two different things
7/30/16, 10:21 PM - Maaruti: How many people did Hindu Mahasabha killed
7/30/16, 10:22 PM - Satish: That's why we are great India and they are unknown Indonesia
7/30/16, 10:22 PM - ANUPAM: I Dont know..
But an ex mahasabha person got radicalised enough to kill Gandhi isn't it
7/30/16, 10:23 PM - Maaruti: Haan Bas Naam Ke Great
7/30/16, 10:23 PM - ANUPAM: Bhinderanwale didn't kill Indira Gandhi.. But radicalised her bodyguards enough
7/30/16, 10:24 PM - ANUPAM: Limited point there is much difference between BJP,RSS,HINDU MAHASABHA,VHP..
all have different agenda
7/30/16, 10:25 PM - ANUPAM: Anyone who does vigilante is wrong ..and killing is the highest wrong ..but even beating up couples on Valentine is wrong..
7/30/16, 10:25 PM - Maaruti: And what followed was also a treat to watch
7/30/16, 10:27 PM - ANUPAM: My point is Indonesia after so many battles ,Egypt also has managed to keep its constitution religion free..and that is good..

Consider a counter example Bangladesh, islamists committed genocide and yet Islam was officially accepted as religion..in effect leading to wiping out of minorities..

7/31/16, 9:47 AM - Satish: Gnagota?
7/31/16, 9:53 AM - ANUPAM: Stereotypes are called so because they are true..
Not politically correct but true..
7/31/16, 9:53 AM - Maaruti: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140422/jsp/bihar/story_18265105.jsp#.V5183_TXenM
7/31/16, 9:53 AM - ANUPAM: Eg. Radiologist is likely to be a top ranker in pg
7/31/16, 9:53 AM - Maaruti: The Mandals
7/31/16, 9:54 AM - ANUPAM: Upper caste is most likely to be bjp supporter
7/31/16, 9:54 AM - Maaruti: Upper caste not likely to be BJP supporter
7/31/16, 9:54 AM - Maaruti: Upper caste don't have a choice but to be a BJP supporter
7/31/16, 9:55 AM - Maaruti: Because if they can't vote for Their Deeni Bhai
7/31/16, 9:55 AM - Maaruti: I don't see a point voting for their Deeni Bhai
7/31/16, 9:55 AM - Maaruti: Or Qaum
7/31/16, 9:56 AM - ANUPAM: Doesn't matter..in the end what they chose is what matters..

True..BJP can't offer constitutionally to upper caste..
May be 10% of economically backward upper caste..
7/31/16, 9:57 AM - ANUPAM: For that matter even mayawati doesn't offer any extra benefit to dalits,except they sense happiness when they see dalits fucking other caste like they used to be
7/31/16, 9:57 AM - Maaruti: When Bhagalpur chose A criminal Bulo Mandal over Shahnawaz Hussain you got to understand the mindset of mass
7/31/16, 9:58 AM - ANUPAM: But in villages/small cities ,if mla/mp is of your own caste it helps alot
7/31/16, 9:58 AM - Maaruti: So when Satish Sir says work for them it's hardly any compliment
7/31/16, 9:58 AM - Maaruti: It's useless and beyond useless
7/31/16, 9:58 AM - ANUPAM: Muslims vote out of fear and victimhood in India..not for development
7/31/16, 9:59 AM - ANUPAM: Others vote for extra benefits
7/31/16, 9:59 AM - Maaruti: Muslims in India vote for sheer hatred
7/31/16, 9:59 AM - ANUPAM: Eg. If I vote for this party it will give me extra benefits
7/31/16, 9:59 AM - Maaruti: They know they are not victimized
7/31/16, 9:59 AM - Maaruti: They are pampered lot
7/31/16, 10:00 AM - Maaruti: They know they will get away with crimes which will bring others to justice
7/31/16, 10:00 AM - Maaruti: But then when it comes to voting they will vote empty Pepsi bottle against BJP
7/31/16, 10:00 AM - ANUPAM: Why should they vote for BJP..when it doesn't give them anything extra..in fact talks of revoking 'illegal' minority status for AMU
7/31/16, 10:01 AM - Maaruti: Precisely
7/31/16, 10:01 AM - Maaruti: They know while others will lap up the shit that they crap in open
7/31/16, 10:01 AM - Maaruti: Why should they vote for BJP
7/31/16, 10:02 AM - ANUPAM: Actually many parties like congress tried to bring Muslim reservation in their states..BJP opposed it tooth and nail
7/31/16, 10:03 AM - ANUPAM: Till it was struck down
7/31/16, 10:03 AM - Maaruti: And whenever Ram Mandir issue comes others make fun of BJP
7/31/16, 10:03 AM - Maaruti: As if Ram Mandir is an issue for BJP alone
7/31/16, 10:04 AM - ANUPAM: Most Hindus Dont give a damn now ,whether ram mandir gets built or not,sad but true..
7/31/16, 10:05 AM - ANUPAM: That is because they are disenchanted with religion like Christians in europe
7/31/16, 10:06 AM - ANUPAM: What material benefits( educational,health) does your religion offer you?
7/31/16, 10:07 AM - ANUPAM: Just carrying on because of cultural inertia
7/31/16, 10:08 AM - ANUPAM: Christians in Europe and america also becoming atheists because state strictly prohibits religion from getting advantage in health and education .
7/31/16, 10:10 AM - Maaruti: Yes
7/31/16, 10:10 AM - ANUPAM: In any case it is well known that babri was constructed by destroying ram temple as were thousands of temple..solution is not to destroy them but ask for autonomy
7/31/16, 10:10 AM - Maaruti: Hindus don't give a Hoot
7/31/16, 10:11 AM - ANUPAM: For your own Hindu schools and hospitals
7/31/16, 10:11 AM - Maaruti: What they don't realize is Ram Bina Ram Rajya nahi

7/31/16, 10:15 AM - ANUPAM: Why demolish a single mosque..
Construct your own..

Open ram hospital, ram school..
Say whoever says jai shriram  will get special privileges .as in free education,health care..

I can guarantee it will bring ram rajya sooner..rather than prolonged and symbolic fights at ayodhya
7/31/16, 10:16 AM - Maaruti: Not possible sir
7/31/16, 10:16 AM - Maaruti: Everyone who chants Jai Shri Ram will be labelled bigot and put behind bars
7/31/16, 10:18 AM - ANUPAM: No make a condition whoever says jai shri ram only will be given free education ..
School is your property
7/31/16, 10:18 AM - Maaruti: And those schools and hospitals
7/31/16, 10:18 AM - Maaruti: They will be target of Bomb blasts
7/31/16, 10:20 AM - ANUPAM: I think destruction of kashi visvanath is mire tragic than babri ..
But instead of focussing on symbolic, be strategic

7/31/16, 10:22 AM - Maaruti: No Point
7/31/16, 10:22 AM - Maaruti: You are right

7/31/16, 7:38 PM - ANUPAM: Wrong can never be corrected..I am realistic enough to know this!
7/31/16, 7:38 PM - ANUPAM: Try to decrease salary of a worker
7/31/16, 7:39 PM - ANUPAM: If you feel he is highly paid..
Much better to increase salary of other( if as deserving)
7/31/16, 7:41 PM - Satish: Anupam is this translation correct...
7/31/16, 7:41 PM - Satish: Then I was wrong all these years...
7/31/16, 7:42 PM - ANUPAM: What is this ?
7/31/16, 7:42 PM - Satish: Shudra Pashu Naari
7/31/16, 7:43 PM - Satish: What's real meaning of those lines
7/31/16, 7:44 PM - Maaruti: Who cremated Jatayu ??
7/31/16, 7:44 PM - Maaruti: And what did Ram say about Jatayu
7/31/16, 7:44 PM - Maaruti: And what did Jatayu say about himself
7/31/16, 7:46 PM - ANUPAM: I Dont have expertise.. On a literal level indeed it looks it is trying to degrade them..
Its interpretation might indeed be other as well..

As is for many religious texts..
7/31/16, 7:47 PM - ANUPAM: There are many alternate explanations on google-fu
7/31/16, 7:47 PM - Satish: Yes
7/31/16, 7:47 PM - Maaruti: Shudra was Nishad Raj
7/31/16, 7:47 PM - Maaruti: Pashu was Jatayu
7/31/16, 7:47 PM - Maaruti: Naari was Shabri
7/31/16, 7:48 PM - Maaruti: I don't know what makes it otherwise
7/31/16, 7:48 PM - ANUPAM: As are sure for difficult to interpret apparently..regressive verses in Quran,old testament and new testament..
Which again can be interpreted in different context
7/31/16, 7:49 PM - Satish: Just like Old Editions
7/31/16, 7:49 PM - Satish: Few old things must go off and new interpretations should come
7/31/16, 7:50 PM - ANUPAM: By the way I have also heard Maya govind say that chadh gaya upar re atariya pe Logan kabootar re..

7/31/16, 7:51 PM - ANUPAM: Itne hi intelligent the to thoda aur saaf likhte
7/31/16, 8:02 PM - Maaruti: Even for argument sake if it's accepted that It means They need to be Beaten that might be prevalent practice in that period
7/31/16, 8:13 PM - Maaruti: Shri Ram aur Tulsidas me Yug ka Antar hai
7/31/16, 8:15 PM - Satish: Tulsidas was many years later when Ramji was born

"In old Roman Courts,
instead of taking oath on 
the sacred books, men used to swear holding their 
testicles.
Hence the word
'testify' originated from      
'testicles'.
If proved false, the testes
of liars were cut 
and fed to the dogs tied nearby.


(This punitive action could
be very effective 
even today, especially for many politicians in power)üòÅüòÇ

8/6/16, 9:11 AM - ANUPAM: How OBC creamy layer is abused..
8/6/16, 9:12 AM - ANUPAM: Govt questions OBC status of many in UPSC list, Backward panel warns of stir

The guidelines formulated by DoPT list certain categories that fall under the creamy layer. While categories like Constitutional posts, Group A/Class I and Group B/Class II are thoroughly enumerated, some categories are not.

WRITTEN BY¬†ASHUTOSH BHARDWAJ¬†| NEW DELHI |Published On:August 6, 2016 5:20 Am

Ôøº

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has questioned the OBC certificates of many candidates who successfully cleared the civil services examination this year, prompting the National Commission for Backward Classes to step in. The Commission has asked the ministries of Social Justice and Empowerment and Personnel to ‚Äúrectify‚Äù their interpretation of the criteria to determine the creamy layer under the OBC category.

With the DoPT maintaining that these candidates come under the creamy layer and are, therefore, not entitled to the benefit of reservation, the Commission, in a series of letters to the two ministries, has underlined that these candidates are indeed OBCs.

‚ÄúIf the misunderstanding of the officers in DoPT is not rectified,‚Äù wrote Commission chairperson Justice (retd) V Eswaraiah to Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot on July 8, it will cause ‚Äúdisheartening‚Äù among the OBCs and ‚Äúaffect the image of good governance‚Äù.

In the letter, Eswaraiah, former acting Chief Justice of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, warned Gehlot that ‚Äúif the criteria for determining creamy layer is not rectified‚Äù, ‚Äúthere will be agitation by OBCs‚Äù and the ‚Äúsituation may be taken advantage by opposition parties‚Äù.

Many candidates have approached the Commission since their appointments to IAS, IPS and IRS have been put on hold. After the matter was raised by some Opposition members, Home MinisterRajnath Singh¬†told¬†Lok Sabha¬†that information has been sought ‚Äúonly to avoid that candidates do not face any litigation in future‚Äù. He said such notices have been sent for many years now and interests of OBC candidates will not be harmed.

But in his letter, Eswaraiah said this was the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù that the DoPT ‚Äúscrutinized‚Äù and ‚Äúmisinterpreted‚Äù the income/wealth test category of ‚Äúgenuine OBC non-creamy layer‚Äù.

Speaking to¬†The Indian Express, Gehlot said he was concerned, but he laid the onus on the DoPT. ‚ÄúThis matter pertains to DoPT. I have asked Jitendra Singhji to resolve it soon. My officers and their officers have also held a meeting in this regard,‚Äù he said.

Gehlot was non-committal about retaining the OBC status of these candidates: ‚ÄúThis matter pertains to the DoPT.‚Äù

In the first week of June, DoPT sent letters to these candidates questioning their OBC status. A letter to candidate Gowrisankar D, who obtained rank 457, stated: ‚ÄúIt has been observed that your father is working in a private organization and his income is more than Rs 6,00,000 per annum for last three consecutive years. You are directed to clarify as to why your OBC (Non Creamy Layer) claim should not be rejected on the ground of more income than prescribed limit.‚Äù
8/6/16, 9:14 AM - ANUPAM: Since the central government has not yet identified comparable posts in these organisations, the income test comes into play. The wealth/income test enumerated in Clause VI of the guidelines caps the gross annual income at Rs 6 lakh for three consecutive years, but it adds a crucial rider that ‚Äúincome from salaries or agricultural land shall not be clubbed‚Äù.

This clause has been the bone of contention between the DoPT and the Backward Commission in the present case.

In its letters to candidates, the DoPT has taken note of the annual income of their parents. But in its letters to the DoPT and Ministry of Social Justice, the Commission has listed a series of government notes and circulars over the last two decades, pointing out that the income criteria cannot be applied in such cases.
8/6/16, 9:15 AM - ANUPAM: Haha by this logic there will be no OBC creamy layer
8/6/16, 9:15 AM - ANUPAM: Irony
8/6/16, 9:16 AM - ANUPAM: According to the Commission‚Äôs contention, since equivalent and comparable posts have not been identified in these categories so far, children of even a chairperson of a PSU or a top bank, who is drawing Rs 20 lakh salary per annum, cannot be excluded from reservation on the basis of the income criteria. The income criteria can be applied only when income from sources other than salary and agriculture exceeds Rs 6 lakh.

8/6/16, 4:52 PM - ANUPAM: The¬†Stanford Prison Experiment¬†(SPE) was a study of the¬†psychological¬†effects of becoming a¬†prisoner¬†or¬†prison guard. The experiment was conducted at¬†Stanford University¬†on August 14‚Äì20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professorPhilip Zimbardo¬†using college students.[1]¬†It was funded by the¬†U.S. Office of Naval Research[2]¬†and was of interest to both theU.S. Navy¬†and¬†Marine Corps¬†as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. The experiment is a classic study on the psychology of imprisonment[3]¬†and is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.[4]

The participants adapted to their roles well beyond Zimbardo's expectations, as the guards enforced¬†authoritarian¬†measures and ultimately subjected some of the prisoners topsychological torture. Many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, at the request of the guards, readily harassed other prisoners who attempted to prevent it. The experiment even affected Zimbardo himself, who, in his role as the¬†superintendent, permitted the abuse to continue.[5][6]

ÔøºTNNThe police, however taking the matter seriously and has given ultimatum to all people that if they try to oppose national flag hoisting in the school on Republic Day then they will have to face serious consequences.

DANKAUR, GREATER NOIDA: Tension erupted in Greater Noida's Dankaur after some extremists opposed flag hoisting and modern education in a muslim girls school on Monday. The school is recognized and registered with minority welfare department of UP since October 2011. On Monday some people from school authority went to the school to install iron rod to fix the flag but miscreants hackled the labour and asked to leave the place. Acting on the issue, the police and administration has swung into action.

The police called some locals to Dankaur police station and they in front of the cops had agitated on giving education of other languages in school. The police, however taking the matter seriously and has given ultimatum to all people that if they try to oppose national flag hoisting in the school on Republic Day then they will have to face serious consequences.


Dankaur police station officer Chakrapani Sharma said that nobody will be allowed to take law in their hand. "Some uneducated persons were opposing flag hoisting ceremony. We have informed our seniors about the incident and to avoid any untoward incident on Tuesday amidst heavy force flag hoisting ceremony will take place in the school. These extremists were also raising questions over teaching Hindi and English. After Republic Day, we will call them and ensure teaching of modern education in the school," Sharma said.

"Saiyyad Bhureshah muslim girl school is running on waqf committee land. Since 2011, education till 5th class is offered to the children. Initially everything was going well but tension cropped up when we decided to offer Hindi and English teaching to the students. We would like to run this school on the line of Centre's scheme of modernization of madarsas' but some extremists are creating trouble," said adir Khan Jayaswal, secretary of the Hazrat Syed Bhureshah Committee.

"Now situation has gone from bad to worse. Teachers have stopped visiting the school and situation is created so that education could not be offered in the school. We had given complaint to the UP chief minister, UP governor, GB Nagar district magistrate, GB Nagar senior superintendent of police and local Dankaur police station about the incident. Despite the fact, some local extremists are mounting pressure on us to withdraw modern education," he added.

"These extremist are also opposing of flag hoisting ceremony on Republic Day. They have threatened us for serious consequences, if we execute flag hoisting. On Monday our staff went to the school land to install rod for the national flag hoisting ceremony but the miscreants hackled staff and asked to leave place," he added.

"On Monday we have again filed complaint with district magistrate office and GB Nagar SSP to ensure flag hoisting ceremony and provide force to avoid any untoward incident," he further said.'

8/7/16, 9:46 PM - Maaruti: So she means Modi got scared because of Sonia
8/7/16, 9:46 PM - Maaruti: Sonia nearly died doing what Modi did
8/7/16, 9:46 PM - ANUPAM: If modi has said in response to dalits, but kept quiet on Muslims..shows he is biased king just doing it for pure politics..

8/7/16, 9:46 PM - ANUPAM: Akhlaq lynching

8/7/16, 9:47 PM - Maaruti: Yesterday also he made it clear
8/7/16, 9:47 PM - Maaruti: When he said Badshaah and Raja Ki Ladai
8/7/16, 9:48 PM - ANUPAM: A person being lynched to death just on suspicion of eating beef..is truly shameful for a nation..
Definitely much more than few guys beaten up
8/7/16, 9:48 PM - ANUPAM: He was pointing at dalit front
8/7/16, 9:49 PM - ANUPAM: Dalits are the cows
8/7/16, 9:49 PM - Maaruti: And Sir It wasn't mere beef eating
8/7/16, 9:49 PM - Maaruti: I won't go for bhawarth
8/7/16, 9:49 PM - Maaruti: But Shabdaarth was pretty sure he was mentioning Badshah and Raja
8/7/16, 9:50 PM - Maaruti: And he can see the came that Cow is being used a Tool to bring him down
8/7/16, 9:51 PM - ANUPAM: Not cow but dalits..

8/7/16, 9:52 PM - Maaruti: Keeping in mind his caste
8/7/16, 9:58 PM - ANUPAM: By mentioning badshah and raja analogy , modi made it clear he was making this statement under pressure..

8/7/16, 9:59 PM - ANUPAM: http://m.firstpost.com/india/allahabad-school-bans-national-anthem-teachers-claim-words-offend-islam-2940890.html
8/7/16, 10:00 PM - ANUPAM: Authorities said that a probe has been launched against M A Convent School based in Baghara locality of the city in the matter and maintained that it was not recognised by the education department.

Zia-ul Haq, the school manager, told the teachers that singing of the national anthem could not be allowed as the phrase 'Bharat Bhagya Vidhata' in its first stanza went against the tenets of Islam, according to the teachers who resigned two days ago.

The manager said that if they were not in agreement with this "policy" of the school, they could leave.
8/7/16, 10:00 PM - ANUPAM: Haq, on his part, stuck to his guns asserting "only Allah can be the Bhagya Vidhata, which means the one who decides our destiny. How can we call Bharat our Bhagya Vidhata?"
8/7/16, 10:01 PM - ANUPAM: ISIS ke school ka manager banana chahiye
8/7/16, 10:02 PM - Maaruti: Why so ??
8/7/16, 10:02 PM - Maaruti: Did he say that Abu Bakar Al Bagdadi our Bhagya Vidhata
8/7/16, 10:04 PM - Maaruti: So if they say Allah is their Bhagya Vidhata nothing wrong
8/7/16, 10:05 PM - Maaruti: And anyways I also support opposition of National Anthem
8/7/16, 10:05 PM - Maaruti: Simply because others Oppose National Song Vande Matram
8/7/16, 10:08 PM - Maaruti: And no one opposed those losers then
8/7/16, 10:10 PM - Maaruti: And yes I have already told you that Indian Flag should be redesigned to be more inclusive

8/7/16, 10:19 PM - Maaruti: No
8/7/16, 10:19 PM - Satish: I don't think such things need to be changed...
8/7/16, 10:19 PM - Maaruti: That won't be inclusive enough
8/7/16, 10:19 PM - Maaruti: Why ??
8/7/16, 10:19 PM - Maaruti: Wasn't Ashok Chakra adopted later
8/7/16, 10:19 PM - Satish: What is important is to act in a manner which is cohesive till a point
8/7/16, 10:20 PM - Maaruti: There was Gandhi Ji ka Charkha instead

8/7/16, 10:22 PM - Satish: Nothing is rigid
8/7/16, 10:22 PM - Satish: If it has to change it will be done by parliament
8/7/16, 10:23 PM - Satish: Not a chutiya at school
8/7/16, 10:23 PM - Maaruti: But then Who said Parliament is supreme
8/7/16, 10:24 PM - Maaruti: There is Justice of Allah above it
8/7/16, 10:24 PM - Satish: I don't think anyone is supreme
8/7/16, 10:24 PM - Satish: Or Inferior
8/7/16, 10:24 PM - Maaruti: Again it doesn't matter what you think
8/7/16, 10:24 PM - Satish: It's your acts which will make you superior and inferior
8/7/16, 10:25 PM - Maaruti: What matters is what the opponent is thinking
8/7/16, 10:25 PM - Satish: Jo Rasthra Ka Nahin Woh Bhagwaan Ka Kya hoga
8/7/16, 10:25 PM - Maaruti: Supermacy of Parliament stands rejected

8/19/16, 11:25 AM - ANUPAM: http://m.timesofindia.com/city/delhi/Dalits-plan-massive-rally-in-Delhi-ahead-of-winter-session/articleshow/53764131.cms
8/19/16, 11:27 AM - ANUPAM: "By Dalits, we mean not only the caste identity or community, but all those who are downtrodden and marginalised people in the larger sense," said Prakash Ambedkar, a political activist and grandson of B R Ambedkar, said Gujarat has become the hub of Dalit protests as "it has turned into a fascist state".He accused BJP and RSS of representing caste hegemony. He is also organising a conference in Delhi on September 12 on the issue of atrocities against Dalits.
The organisers are planning to organise Dalit marches from places of significance in terms of historical incidents of atrocities against Dalits, such as Laxmanpur Bathe in Bihar (1997). State-wise plans are being taken up ahead of the rally that organisers hope will be attended by 10 lakh people and the mobilisation is expected to take between August 29 and the first week of September. Marches will be held from Dalit localities to areas with Muslim presence or vice versa
8/19/16, 11:28 AM - Satish: Dalit is Kanhaiya Kumar and Party
8/19/16, 11:28 AM - Satish: Takes all freebies and talk of Azaadi...Haramazaadi
8/19/16, 11:29 AM - ANUPAM: Basically trying to build dalit-muslim alliance
8/19/16, 11:29 AM - ANUPAM: Asking for reservation in private sector etc.
8/19/16, 11:31 AM - ANUPAM: Now people laugh when I talk about reservation in private sector is impossible..

Remember there is reservation for 25% kids in private schools..
8/19/16, 11:34 AM - Satish: I said this 2 months back and you laughed on me
8/19/16, 11:36 AM - ANUPAM: People have been trying to build dalit Muslim alliance for 150 years
8/19/16, 11:37 AM - Satish: No this time is different
8/19/16, 11:37 AM - ANUPAM: I tell you of a basic fault line..
No difference
8/19/16, 11:38 AM - ANUPAM: If islamist think of Hindus as inferior , just imagine what they think of dalits
8/19/16, 11:39 AM - ANUPAM: You should revisit meenakshipuram and what happened after that
8/19/16, 11:41 AM - ANUPAM: In meenakshipuram 300 dalits converted en mass to Islam, Indira Gandhi introduced strict anti conversion laws after that
8/19/16, 11:43 AM - Satish: In my book Dalit and Muslim unholiest  of all alliance
8/19/16, 11:44 AM - Satish: Dalit remained Hindu inspite of Torture from Barbarians and Hindus alike
8/19/16, 11:44 AM - Satish: And reaping Great dividend in form of reservations
8/19/16, 11:51 AM - ANUPAM: Dalits wanted separate electorate like Muslims , Gandhi ji did Poona pact..

Ambedkar was right that feeling of superiority of caste Hindus will never go..even when they are down in dumps
8/19/16, 11:55 AM - ANUPAM: I ask you a question. You had an intercaste marriage and you are rightly proud of it as we all of us should be. How strict your family and in-laws opposition would have been,if either of you would have been dalit or muslim
8/19/16, 12:08 PM - Maaruti: There should be Reservatjon in Pvt sector
8/19/16, 12:08 PM - Maaruti: Why should Govt only suffer
8/19/16, 12:10 PM - Maaruti: And Our families do accept Intercaste marriage

8/19/16, 12:11 PM - Maaruti: In a seamless manner
8/19/16, 12:11 PM - Maaruti: And I so feel that Ambedkar was Mayawati of his time
8/19/16, 12:16 PM - ANUPAM: No they won't..
I am pointing out to
Difference between intercaste marriage( Hindu non-dalit ) n marriage to dalit
8/19/16, 12:23 PM - Satish: Bhai this question was for me??
8/19/16, 12:26 PM - ANUPAM: For you..yes
8/19/16, 12:26 PM - Satish: I don't know or can't predict...
8/19/16, 12:27 PM - Satish: But should have been ...
8/19/16, 12:27 PM - Satish: Is anybody guess
8/19/16, 12:28 PM - Satish: When I encourage intercaste marriage..its more for getting of idiosyncratic caste trap which weakens Hindu and Nation
8/19/16, 12:28 PM - Satish: Muslim have caste system as well as caste system
8/19/16, 12:29 PM - Satish: Furthermore their is no guarantee of caste marriages or intercaste marriages are good
8/19/16, 12:29 PM - Satish: Also many a time caste is an excuse to have fun with all and marry the best professionally in its caste...
8/19/16, 12:30 PM - Satish: My personal experience
8/19/16, 12:31 PM - ANUPAM: Dalits say this..and listen carefully..they say we are treated at much lower level in Hindu society..
Now that we have got political and economic representation( by reservation in jobs ,education )..we now seek social equality to upper caste and OBC
8/19/16, 12:31 PM - Maaruti: Sir Sirf Gadhe ek Colour Ke aate hain
8/19/16, 12:31 PM - Maaruti: Variety should always be strength
8/19/16, 12:32 PM - Satish: Sirf Gadhe wants to marry it's own Nasal
8/19/16, 12:32 PM - Satish: Same color same caste
8/19/16, 12:32 PM - Satish: Be a horse
8/19/16, 12:32 PM - Satish: Variety is key to success
8/19/16, 12:34 PM - ANUPAM: Satish your family and your inlaws are highly educated creme la creme..

still they would have resisted strongly marrying a dalit..

Important thing is dalits are under confusion they can change other Hindu castes mind by abusing them or doing a Muslim's alliance..

If at all it will happen..it will happen via urbanization
8/19/16, 12:34 PM - Maaruti: No
8/19/16, 12:34 PM - Maaruti: Donkey with a Mare makes Mule
8/19/16, 12:34 PM - Maaruti: Marriage is the most unscientific concept
8/19/16, 12:34 PM - Maaruti: It weakens society
8/19/16, 12:36 PM - ANUPAM: Did dalits gain respect by forcing that mayawati abuser's resignation or abusing her wife
8/19/16, 12:37 PM - ANUPAM: They are not in numerical majority to pull up such a stunt.. And will be screwed up big time..if they overplay their hand
8/19/16, 12:38 PM - Maaruti: D Litt is a degree now
8/19/16, 12:38 PM - Satish: Do you think they are not screwed abhi

8/20/16, 11:06 AM - ANUPAM: However on a day when his ward Sindhu etched her name in the Indian sporting history as the first ever woman to win a silver medal, the strict teacher is ready to become an indulgent elder brother.

With 'mission accomplished', Sindhu can now get back to being another 21-year-old, who would now be able to whatsApp her friends and enjoy her favourite ice-cream.

"Sindhu did not have her phone during the last three months. The first thing is I would return her phone. The second thing, after coming here for last 12-13 days, I had deprived her from having sweet curd which she likes most. I also stopped her from eating ice-cream. Now she can eat whatever she wants," an elated Gopi said after Sindhu's silver winning feat.

8/21/16, 7:33 AM - ANUPAM: Last year¬†Uber, a taxi-hailing firm,¬†recruited 40 of the 140 staff of the National Robotics Engineering Centre at Carnegie Mellon University, and set up¬†a unit to work on self-driving cars.¬†That drew headlines because Uber had earlier promised to fund research at the centre before deciding instead to peel off its staff. Other firms seek talent more quietly but just as doggedly. The migration to the private sector startles many academics.¬†‚ÄúI cannot even hold onto my¬†grad students,‚Äù says Pedro Domingos, a professor at the University of Washington who specialises in machine learning and has himself had¬†job¬†offers from tech firms. ‚ÄúCompanies are trying to hire them away before they graduate.‚Äù¬†

Experts in machine learning are most in demand. Big tech firms use it in many activities, from basic tasks such as spam-filtering and better targeting of online advertisements, to futuristic endeavours such as self-driving cars or scanning images to identify disease. As tech giants work on features such as virtual personal-assistant technology, to help users organise their lives, or tools to make it easier to search through photographs, they rely on advances in machine learning.

8/21/16, 11:00 AM - ANUPAM: I think in every party, every father has a tendency to promote his son. Today, I am saying all this, but I don‚Äôt know that at some point of time, I may have to eat my own words. My son will grow up and might say, ‚ÄòI want to be in politics‚Äô. So I appreciate the concern of many Congress CMs, because as a father I also know that it is very difficult to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to my son. That is why you need people like Narendra Modi who can say ‚Äòno‚Äô to the face. People want a leader ‚Äòjo galat hai, munh pe bol do (saying what is wrong to the face)‚Äô. I am a father and unless I have a leader like Modi, nobody will stop me (from promoting my own). So India needs more and more leaders like Modi. In Assam, we were told on the very first day: ‚ÄòBhai aise logon ko ticket mat dena (Don‚Äôt give tickets to such leaders)‚Äô. Now, in the Congress, you will never hear this.

8/22/16, 8:39 AM - ANUPAM: I think substantial money can be made out of ghrwaapsi to dalit fold by pandits..üòã
8/22/16, 8:39 AM - ANUPAM: A great startup to make money
8/22/16, 8:42 AM - ANUPAM: Peter said the discrimination faced by Dalit converts in Christianity was also a reason for reconversions.
‚ÄúMost of the converts feel that they are being treated as second-class members. The mainstream section will not make any matrimonial alliance with us. The number of Dalit priests in Kerala is also less. There are many instances of parishers opposing the appointment of Dalit priests,‚Äù he said.
He said some Christian cemeteries have separate burial place for Dalit Christians.
Former spokesperson of Syro Malabar Church Paul Thelakkat said the reconversions were mostly under the lure of reservation benefits. ‚ÄúDespite strict direction by churches, we have to admit that caste discrimination does exist. The Church views the issue seriously and efforts are being taken to ensure equal status for converts,‚Äù he said.

8/23/16, 7:37 AM - Pankaj Jha: A New Zealander's view on reason for corruption in India:
Indians¬†are¬†Hobbesian (Culture of self interest)

Corruption in¬†India¬†is¬†a cultural aspect.¬†Indians¬†seem to think nothing peculiar about corruption. It is everywhere.¬†¬†

Indians¬†tolerate corrupt individuals rather than correct them.¬†

No race can be congenitally corrupt.

But can a race be corrupted by its culture?¬†¬†

To know why Indians are corrupt, look at their¬†patterns and practices.

Firstly:
Religion is transactional in¬† India.

Indians¬†give God cash and anticipate an out-of-turn reward.¬†

Such a¬†plea acknowledges that favours are needed for the undeserving.¬†¬†

In the world outside the temple walls,¬†such a transaction is¬†named ‚Äúbribe‚Äù.¬†¬†

A wealthy Indian gives not cash to temples, but gold crowns and such baubles.¬†

His gifts can not feed the poor. His¬†pay-off is for God.¬†He thinks it¬†will be¬†wasted if it goes to a needy man.¬†

In June 2009, The Hindu published a report of Karnataka minister G. Janardhan Reddy gifting a crown of gold and diamonds worth Rs 45 crore to Tirupati.¬†

India‚Äôs temples collect so much¬†that¬†they don't know what to do with it. Billions are¬†gathering dust in temple vaults.¬†

When Europeans came to¬†India ¬†they built schools.¬†When Indians¬†go to Europe & USA, they build¬†temples.¬†

Indians believe that¬†if God accepts money¬†for his favours, then nothing¬†is wrong in doing the same thing. This is why Indians are so easily corruptible.¬†

Indian¬†culture accommodates such transaction 

First: Morally.¬†There is  no real stigma. An  utterly corrupt¬†JayaLalita¬†can make a comeback, just unthinkable in the West.¬†

Secondly:
Indian¬†moral ambiguity towards corruption is¬†visible in its history.¬†Indian history tells of the capture of cities and kingdoms after guards were paid off to open the gates, and commanders paid off to surrender.¬†

This is unique to¬†India.¬†

Indians'¬†corrupt nature has meant limited warfare on the subcontinent.

It is striking how little Indians have actually fought compared to ancient¬† Greece¬†and modern¬†Europe.¬†

The Turk's battles with Nadir Shah were vicious and fought to the finish.¬†

In¬†India¬†fighting wasn't needed, bribing was enough¬†to see off¬†armies.¬†

Any invader willing to spend cash could¬†brush aside¬†India‚Äôs kings, no matter how many tens of thousands soldiers¬†were in their infantry.¬†

Little resistance was given by the Indians at the ‚ÄúBattle‚Äù of Plassey.¬†

Clive paid off Mir Jaffar and all of¬†Bengal¬†folded to an army of 3,000.¬†

There was always a financial exchange to taking Indian¬†forts. Golconda¬†was captured in 1687 after the secret back door was left open.¬†

Mughals vanquished Marathas and Rajputs with nothing but bribes.¬†

The Raja of Srinagar gave up Dara Shikoh‚Äôs son Sulaiman to¬†Aurangzeb after receiving a bribe.¬†

There are many cases where Indians¬†participated on a large scale in¬†treason due to bribery.¬†

Question is: Why Indians¬†have a transactional culture while¬†other¬†'civilized' nations don't?¬†

Thirdly:
Indians do not believe¬†in the theory that they¬†all can rise if each of them¬†behaves morally, because that is not¬†the message of their¬†faith.¬†

Their caste system separates them.¬†

They don't believe that all men are equal.¬†

This resulted in their division and migration to other religions.¬†

Many Hindus¬†started their own¬†faith like Sikh, Jain, Buddha¬†and many¬†converted to Christianity and Islam.¬†

The result¬†is that Indians¬†don't¬†trust one another.¬†

There are no Indians in¬†India, there are¬†Hindus, Christians, Muslims and what not.¬†

Indians forget that 1400 years ago they all belonged to one faith.¬†

This division evolved an unhealthy culture.¬†The inequality has resulted in a corrupt society,¬†in¬†India¬†every one is thus¬†against everyone else,¬†except God ¬≠and even he must be bribed.

8/24/16, 4:54 PM - Pankaj Jha: *Lay man's Thinking*

An engineer in a car manufacturing company designs a world class car.
The owner is impressed with the outcome and praised him a lot. 
While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the office they realised that the car is few inches taller than the entrance. 
The engineer felt bad that he didn't notice this one before creating the car. 
The owner was amazed on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area. 
The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car that he will do the tinkering later on. 
The engineer said that they can break the entrance and after taking the car out, they can cement it. 
The owner was not convinced with any ideas and felt like it is a bad sign to break or scratch.

*The watchman* was watching all the drama and slowly approached the owner. 
He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem.
They wondered  what this guy would tell them that the experts could not give.

Watchman said that *The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so if they release the AIR in the tyre, the height of the car will be adjusted and can be easily taken out.*

Everyone clapped!!

*LESSON :*
```Don't encounter problems from the expert point of view. 
There is always a``` *LAYMAN point* ```that will gives the best solution in a given point of time...```
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Life issues are also  same.

Many a time a friend's entrance door fall short by few inches, we feel taller!!
Release some air (ego) and adjust the height.

8/25/16, 11:52 AM - Pankaj Jha: *Krishna* was born in the darkness of the night, into the locked confines of a jail.

However, at the moment of his birth, all the guards fell asleep, the chains were broken and the barred doors gently opened.

Similarly, as soon as *Krishna* ( Chetna, Awareness ) takes birth in our hearts, all darkness ( Negativity ) fades.

All chains ( Ego, I, Me, Myself ) are broken.

And all prison doors we keep ourselves in ( Caste, Religion, Profession, Relations etc )  are opened. 

And that is the real Message And Essence of Janmashtmi.

Happy *Janmashtmi* to all of you and your family.
God Bless and keep well.

8/28/16, 11:49 AM - ANUPAM: http://www.echarcha.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-25710.html
8/28/16, 11:49 AM - Maaruti: Meera Kumar
8/28/16, 11:51 AM - ANUPAM: KHUSHWANT SINGH

I was editor of the National Herald in 1978. We were not paid any salary then as the Congress was short on funds. Indira Gandhi was out of power after the Emergency debacle swept the Janata Party to power.
Her daughter-in-law Maneka Gandhi had started a magazine called Surya and Indira Gandhi asked me to help her out with the magazine.
Earlier Amteshwar Anand, Maneka's mother who claimed to be my distant relative had personally visited me at my residence with Indira Jaising and sought my help for Maneka's magazine Surya.¬†
One fine Sunday morning, an important day for a sardar as he has to wash his hair that day, they arrived unannounced draped in chiffon and perfume only to be greeted by me in a sardarji's kachcha (underwear) with my hair, a tangled mane, wet and streaming open.¬†
They requested me to help Maneka with the magazine she was planning to launch Surya. I relented.
I worked with Surya as the consulting editor and would invariably end up writing or rewriting all the stories.¬†
One day when I reached the National Herald office, I saw an envelope lying on my table. I opened the envelope, had one look and recognised who was in the picture.
Suresh Ram, son of Jagjivan Ram.
If the Kamasutra has 64 poses of making love, this one certainly had 10.
By evening, an interesting development took place. An emissary arrived from Jagjivan Ram saying that if the pics were not published, Jagjivan Ram would dump Morarjee and join Indira Gandhi. I took the pictures to Indira Gandhi and showed them to her.
I conveyed the message to Indira Gandhi and she said: "First ask him to dump Morarjee and then only will I guarantee the pictures will not be published". It never happened. Maneka was very keen to use the pics in her magazine Surya.
And so the pics got published as a centrespread in Surya and were also published by the National Herald. We had to use tapes on strategic body organs. They were so graphic that we could be sued for obscenity. And all these pictures had been organized by Suresh Ram who had a self timed Polaroid camera placed in his room.
Suresh and his father Jagjivan were great womanisers. They often used to share their women between them.
Years later, Maneka took me to court because I wrote about her in my book. She held up the release of my book for six years on charges of invasion of privacy when she herself published the pictures!
8/28/16, 11:52 AM - ANUPAM: Basically porn pics of jagjivan ram's son were used by menaka Gandhi and Indira Gandhi and charan singh whose daal K.C. tyagi you see now a days to break janta government

8/29/16, 3:27 PM - ANUPAM: If people Dont against supporting  beef eating parties..it means they Dont have much problem..
8/29/16, 3:28 PM - ANUPAM: It was congress( of Indira Gandhi vintage ) though which passed strictest laws against cow killing and conversion
8/29/16, 3:29 PM - ANUPAM: Manohar parrikar( a saraswat brahmin)..as chief minister of goa said he has no problems with people eating beef there
8/29/16, 3:40 PM - ANUPAM: Few points I have realised after thinking..
1. Indian people are casteist BUT  religious.
2. Indian political parties due to fragmentation use minorities as vote banks by instilling fear/benefits.
3. Hindus,dalits and Muslims ( maximum ) live in state of apartheid.
4. To compensate for this discrimination ,liberals make anti Hindu laws, whereas we all know changing laws will change nothing.
5. While Indian state is pro minority( laws,policy), Indian machinery is anti minority.
6. If a resentment happens against minority leaders due to their being emboldened( Sonia,manmohan ,udit raj) in majority community..they would be fucked forever..
8/29/16, 3:45 PM - Maaruti: Caste >> Religion
8/29/16, 3:47 PM - Maaruti: Muslims ( Religion >> Their own Ashraf , Anjal etc etc ) but only in India Sunni will tolerate Shia because they feel their common enemy is Hindu , they will tolerate even Christians
8/29/16, 5:53 PM - Satish: Religion and caste are tools to get Power ...from time immemorial
8/29/16, 5:53 PM - Satish: Earlier used by Politicians and now by common people to get
8/29/16, 5:53 PM - Satish: Women, Job etc...
8/29/16, 5:54 PM - Satish: Best way is to control that in name of Religion and caste..It helps in larger picture..
8/29/16, 5:54 PM - Satish: Hindus are likely to unite if Muslim show United face...which they did last few elections
8/29/16, 5:56 PM - Satish: Dailts still not integrated to other Hindus the way it should have been
8/29/16, 5:56 PM - Satish: Primarily congress never wants it...
8/29/16, 5:57 PM - Satish: Bjp thinks Dailts should not be integrated as it may impact it's brahmin baniya votebank
8/29/16, 5:58 PM - Satish: It's always like that...Dalit and Gujjar not friends otherwise but get United in election to defeat Jats many a time...
8/29/16, 5:59 PM - Satish: Any Law which appeases minority is biggest risk on Minority of getting them marginalised more

8/29/16, 6:47 PM - Satish: I am in for Freedom of cloth
8/29/16, 6:48 PM - Kashif: Point here is : why do men get to decide what women can or cannot wear. Be it Middle East, india, France , rest of Europe or USA
8/29/16, 6:48 PM - Kashif: Reason is simple: society is still male dominated
8/29/16, 6:48 PM - Kashif: And patriarchal
8/29/16, 6:49 PM - Satish: So should it be like that
8/29/16, 6:49 PM - Satish: ??

8/29/16, 6:55 PM - Kashif: I believe time and again they have shown to be better in intelligence and judgement
8/29/16, 6:56 PM - Satish: And most importantly if someone suggest Skirt cannot be done or Burqah should be done..lead by example in their own life...

Rahul and Kejriwal  moved to Paris where they made friends with a French guy named Jean Paul.

They used to go all over Paris with him when suddenly one day...
Jean Paul disappeared.

The two went to the police and lodged a complaint. 

The police asked them if they could give some vital clues about Jean Paul that would help find him. 

Rahul  says...
"Jean-Paul was handsome and tall "

Police say...
"Most Frenchmen are like that. Give us something specific " 

Kejriwal  says...
"Jean Paul had blue eyes and was very fair "

Police say...
"C'mon guys, lots of Frenchmen have blue eyes and fair hair, tell us something specific " 

Rahul  and Kejriwal ...
"Oh yes...now we remember. Jean Paul had two holes in his ass "

The Policemen get really interested. 

"Now that's something very specific, but tell us, how do you know this? 
Have you guys seen it ?"

Rahul  and Kejriwal ...
"No we haven‚Äôt actually seen the holes, but wherever we went with  Jean Paul, everyone used to say... 
"Here comes Jean Paul with the two assholes "!!!üòúüòÄüòÇ

8/31/16, 1:38 PM - ANUPAM: http://www.livemint.com/Money/gtMT7lWeS8n2nyIZ3HLZON/How-good-is-it-How-bad-is-it.html
8/31/16, 1:39 PM - ANUPAM: Are we doing better or worse? Much of the popular discourse is muddied with commentary on issues that have little to do with the economy: there is a lot of angst over issues of tolerance, communal tensions, rewriting history. I‚Äôve been asking this question of all the people I meet‚Äîcorporate leaders, bureaucrats, academics, regulators, heads of institutions: what‚Äôs going on, are things better or worse?

All of them say three things. One, corruption in the central government is gone. There is a tough message out from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office that graft will not be tolerated. Everybody I spoke to said that indeed the extortions from every project were gone. Graft in the lower bureaucracy and in local governments persists and is very deep-rooted. But at the Centre, it is gone. There is an overall drive against black money with various schemes being tried to put a plug on it. The same hard stand has been taken with bank loans and one place to start has been the process of selection of public sector bank chiefs. A member of the committee who would interview candidates for public sector bank chairmen told me that after 2014, they stopped getting calls from the power centre on who to hire. The rate used to be fixed, he said, we were just told to pick the name told to us. Who‚Äôd pay? Firms that would then benefit from easy loans and terms. Those calls have stopped.

The hardening stance of the state on black money shows up in the prices of real estate. Real estate has been the sump of black money in India and the politician-builder-land mafia nexus had raised prices to a level that was beyond any economic logic. People who bought their¬†Rs.8 crore luxury floors in Gurgaon are unable to find a buyer at half the price. The winter for real estate is going to last a long time‚Äîso if you are still holding on to an investment thinking it will recover, plan on bequests rather than profits in the near future.

Two, policy paralysis is over and the government is executing plans, many of these are carry-overs from the previous government and some that were announced but were not executed. Aadhaar is a great example of the Modi government carrying forward a project that is so key to India‚Äôs progress. The Jan Dhan scheme has added millions of unbanked to the banking sector‚Äôs customer base.

Three, key individual ministries are doing well‚Äîpower, roads, defence, railways, telecom‚Äîand are showing results. These are core industries and will bear fruit over the long-term. Those looking for a quick return to the 2008 growth rates will be disappointed. One criticism that my small dip-stick revealed is over the hurry that the government is in to do things; another complaint is that some of the announced schemes don‚Äôt have deep-enough roots.

So why the noise?
8/31/16, 1:39 PM - ANUPAM: Modi, as a Delhi outsider, has shut down access to power and its benefits. Notice the way illegally occupied bungalows in central Delhi have been vacated
8/31/16, 1:43 PM - Maaruti: Big ministers are all corruption free
8/31/16, 1:43 PM - Maaruti: It's not Modi alone
8/31/16, 3:07 PM - ANUPAM: http://swarajyamag.com/politics/athavales-25-quota-for-upper-castes-will-destroy-whats-left-of-meritocracy
8/31/16, 3:08 PM - ANUPAM: Athavale‚Äôs thinking, however, is not unusual for politicians. They love quotas. A quota, by definition, is required when demand is in excess of supply, and politicians love quotas because they can then create electoral rent-seeking opportunities by promising you a share of quota.
When jobs are in short supply, politicians will be right there doling out access to the few jobs going.
Politicians are instinctively demand siders, as offering supply side solutions and abundance will make their services redundant.
To make housing for the poor an electoral offering, politicians bottle up supplies of land, make it horrendously expensive, and enact a Land Acquisition Act. Once you kill the land market, politicians have a role to play is distributing shortage.
To make education an electoral benefit, politicians will enact a Right to Education Act so that schools that are providing a modicum of education close down and the masses rush to the few remaining good schools available. Politicians can then distribute what is in short supply, making money from admissions and quotas.
To make food an electoral issue, you need to destroy the food market through minimum support prices and a Food Security Act. Once food prices at shops bear no resemblance to real costs of production or market prices, you effectively destroy the food market, and what you have left is state-determined food supply and control system which politicians can dominate.
Whether it is education or food or jobs, India needs a supply side situation. We need to create more jobs, not redistribute what jobs are there among various castes and communities through quotas. Athavale‚Äôs idea is a job destroyer.

8/31/16, 9:21 PM - ANUPAM: Kitna bada chorkat aadmi hai sandeep kumar..look what he says about his wife..
8/31/16, 9:22 PM - ANUPAM: On March 8, International Women‚Äôs Day, the 34-year-old minister had thanked wife Ritu for the ‚Äúsacrifices‚Äù she had made for him, and, to thunderous applause from a packed auditorium at the Delhi Secretariat, added, ‚ÄúMain roz subah inke pair chhoota hoon (I touch her feet every morning).‚Äù
A fortnight later, Kumar smiles that he has been following the practice since Ritu, 29, and he got married on April 5, 2011. ‚ÄúSometimes she says ‚Äòkhoob tarakki karo (be very successful)‚Äô, but mostly she just smiles. My friends sometimes ask jokingly if she says ‚Äòsada suhagan raho (Have a long, married life)‚Äô.‚Äù
8/31/16, 9:23 PM - ANUPAM: Explaining why he started touching Ritu‚Äôs feet, Kumar says, ‚ÄúI touch my parents‚Äô feet because they brought me into this world, raised me and gave me a good education. But after them, it is my wife who has been with me through thick and thin and I respect her just as much.‚Äù
Since his March 8 speech recounting this, Kumar has been getting phone calls from across the country. ‚ÄúA 93-year-old uncle from Meghalaya said he was happy to hear what I had said. But there were others who were angry. They asked me how I could make such statements in a male-dominated society. I told them that it is this mentality they have to change. A person who does not respect women has no right to be called a human being,‚Äù Kumar says.

9/1/16, 11:28 AM - ANUPAM: But deep packet inspection has a dark side, and in the absence of strict legal restrictions, your ISP is free to root through all the information you exchange online and use it as they see fit. Personal data like your age, location, and shopping records can be logged and sold in anonymized batches to advertising companies, and law enforcement agents can monitor and curtail your Internet access without your knowledge. Without strict limitations to preserve user privacy, this sort of deep data filtering can significantly impair your ability to remain anonymous online.

This level of surveillance is nothing new; Internet service providers in China already employ deep packet inspection software to scan for sensitive keywords and¬†block access¬†to sites like¬†YouTube.¬†

9/2/16, 4:56 PM - ANUPAM: http://indiauncut.com/iublog/article/the-god-delusion-of-arvind-kejriwal/
9/2/16, 4:57 PM - ANUPAM: Contrary to popular belief, the majority religion in India is not Hinduism but the religion of government. We have been brought up believing that if there is any problem in this world, government can solve it. If there is a social ill, ban it. If prices are too high, pass a law demanding that they be kept low. If there aren‚Äôt enough jobs out there, create jobs by legislation so that people can earn an honest living. And so on.
I call this, with apologies to Richard Dawkins, the God Delusion of Government. Devotees of this particular religion believe, like devotees of any other, that reality is subject to the whims and fancies of their God. To change the state of the world, God needs to merely decree it, or government needs to pass a law, and boom, reality changes. Water turns to amrut, copper to gold.
This kind of God delusion isn‚Äôt restricted to India. A recent example of a country ruined by it is Venezuela, which has been ravaged by the socialist policies of Hugo Chavez. Venezuela was lucky to be oil-rich, but unlucky to have Chavez as a leader, who tried social engineering on a vast scale. One of his pet schemes: price controls on all essential commodities. (If something should be cheaper, let‚Äôs make a law mandating it.) This led, as econ 101 would predict, to shortages, so much so that Venezuela‚Äôs queues became legendary. The current government, perturbed that these queues were embarrassing the country, hit upon an innovative solution. It banned queues .
I‚Äôm not kidding. They really banned queues, and when I read that news, I thought of Kejriwal, because that‚Äôs exactly what he would do.
Kejriwal thrives on finding the simplest possible solution to every problem through the Godlike intervention of government. He has no grasp on reality, though, and no understanding of how such interventions typically play out. Most tellingly, like Chavez and other socialists, he simply doesn‚Äôt understand how the price system works.

9/2/16, 5:38 PM - Kashif: Anupam you are wrong . Bill Clinton was not impeached because he had sex. He was impeached because he lied under oath. Please look up.

9/2/16, 5:39 PM - Maaruti: And what did he lie ??
9/2/16, 5:39 PM - Kashif: About the sex

9/2/16, 5:43 PM - Kashif: I am not supporting any aap minister
9/2/16, 5:43 PM - Satish: Also he did 7 years back
9/2/16, 5:43 PM - Satish: So its wrong to use this now
9/2/16, 5:44 PM - Kashif: But I am supporting every married mans right to have consensual sex outside of marriage without it being a crime
9/2/16, 5:44 PM - Maaruti: And Married Man ??
9/2/16, 5:45 PM - Maaruti: Why should a married women continue to be with that man ??
9/2/16, 5:45 PM - Maaruti: Woman

9/2/16, 5:46 PM - Kashif: That's the women's decision to make
9/2/16, 5:46 PM - Kashif: We as society should not have any say in their personal matter
9/2/16, 5:46 PM - Maaruti: So in nutshell Marriage as an Institution is Fake or should it be abolished ??
9/2/16, 5:46 PM - Kashif: I also support married right to have sex outside of marriage
9/2/16, 5:46 PM - Satish: Maruti tohra Vivah kab hai

9/2/16, 5:47 PM - Maaruti: Sir I don't believe in Marriage
9/2/16, 5:47 PM - Kashif: The currency may differ : money, respect, freedom
9/2/16, 5:47 PM - Maaruti: Neither scientifically nor socially
9/2/16, 5:47 PM - Satish: Haramkhor Haaram bana
9/2/16, 5:48 PM - Kashif: Hahaha

9/2/16, 5:49 PM - Kashif: How is that
9/2/16, 5:49 PM - Maaruti: Ok few Questions
9/2/16, 5:49 PM - Maaruti: 1. How long is the concept of society on this earth
9/2/16, 5:50 PM - Maaruti: 2. How long is the concept of marriage in this society
9/2/16, 5:50 PM - Maaruti: 3. How long is the history of Mankind   ?
9/2/16, 5:50 PM - Maaruti: Answer these three you will have answer to your own questions
9/2/16, 5:51 PM - Maaruti: This is scientifically speaking
9/2/16, 5:51 PM - Maaruti: Coming to socially speaking , how bad genes enter into next generation
9/2/16, 5:52 PM - Maaruti: The guys who would never ever get a chance to mate in their own life and thereby nature ensuring their bad genes end gets a lease of new generation when they are provided a mate by the society
9/2/16, 5:53 PM - Maaruti: And that is called Marriagev
9/2/16, 5:53 PM - Maaruti: So it's an anti social act to get married
9/2/16, 5:57 PM - Satish: Best Positioned is Bachelor
9/2/16, 5:59 PM - ANUPAM: Marriage is illusion of opportunity to have free sex with wife.

9/2/16, 6:02 PM - Satish: Salute
9/2/16, 6:05 PM - ANUPAM: Efficiency and stability are always in conflict with each other. Marriage is for stability of society. Considerable individual cost.
9/2/16, 6:06 PM - ANUPAM: As individualism rises( secure,free,stable times) marriages will break down..when war ,fear,insecurity rises..marriages will return.
9/2/16, 6:06 PM - Maaruti: Some wives and husbands are so bad .. Free me Bhi sex na Kare

Are offerings by #JIO misleading?

___________

Reliance Jio: The champion of Digital India or Analog India?

I must admit that I was euphoric over the Reliance Jio launch today morning. Also, thanks to the media hype, I initially believed that it was a "revolutionary" service for data users like me who are glued to the internet all the time.  But as the hours passed, reality began to sink in. 
After some quick analysis, I have come to the conclusion that it is not for data users lke me who are constantly browsing the internet, but instead, it is actually for those who are constantly chattering on phone. 

Let me take up some of the hyped up highlights & try to explain why it does not convince me to make a switch.

1) First & foremost, it is portrayed as the messiah for data users. All the news channels have been highlighting that the data charges on Reliance Jio is as low as Rs 50/GB. This is actually highly misleading because that low rate of Rs 50/GB would be applicable only when you buy the high end monthly pack of Rs 4,999 per month!! In that pack, you get around 75 GB which roughly translates to Rs 50/GB. But in a normal pack like Rs 499 per month, you get only 4 GB, which translates to around Rs 100/GB. And if you consider the Rs 19 pack which gives 100 MB, it translates to around Rs 190/GB. 

2) In the entry level package of Rs 149 per month, although you get unlimited voice calls (which is highly appreciated), you get only 300 MB of data. So, it is definitely not for a data user like me, but for someone who hardly uses internet, and wants unlimited calling. 

3) The Rs 19/day pack is marketed as a chota pack which can cater to casual users who want to browse internet on a need basis. But there is nothing revolutionary about it because it offers only 100 MB for Rs 19 & the validity is 1 day. Suppose I am on the Rs 149/month pack and I exhaust my 300 MB within few days and one fine day I want to book an Ola cab or watch a 1 min YouTube video, then I must shell out a minimum of Rs 19. (There is no pack smaller than that). But if I am on Airtel/Idea/Vodafone, I can go for their Rs 9 pack and get 35 MB. i.e Instead of spending Rs 19 on Reliance Jio to book an Ola cab, I can recharge Rs 9 on Airtel & get the work done. Also, it is to be noted that Airtel/Idea offer 100 MB of 4G data for Rs 24 which has a validity of 3 days, which I feel is much better than Jio's 100 MB of 4G data for Rs 19 which has a validity of 1 day.

4) As explained above, the Rs 149/month pack makes no sense for data users because it gives only 300 MB. The next pack is the Rs 499/month pack which has 4 GB of data (along with the default unlimited calling feature). Since unlimited calling is available in both the Rs 149 pack as well as Rs 499 pack, then the only difference is that the 499 pack gives you additional 3.7 GB of data at an additional cost of Rs 350.
=> Rs 350 for 3.7 GB? Sorry, not convincing. Your own brother Anil Ambani has been offering 10 GB of data for less than Rs 400. Yes, I agree that while they are offering 3G, you are offering 4G, but at the end of the day, the total data remains the same. 

5) Let me take up the next pack. Rs 999. I get 10 GB of data (along with the default unlimited calling feature). 
Compared to the Rs 149 pack which already has unlimited calling feature, what I get in this pack is effectively 9.7 GB of data for Rs 850. 
I am not impressed because if I spend a little extra, I can get unlimited 3G from BSNL. Yes, Unlimited 3G by BSNL for Rs 1099. 
Check this:
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/BSNL-gives-unlimited-3G-plan-for-Rs-1099-doubles-data-limit-for-existing-plans/articleshow/53858131.cms

6) Now that I have seen how even the Rs 999 pack fails to impress me, due to much better offering from BSNL. Why should I pay Rs 999 to Reliance for 10 GB data, when BSNL is offering me unlimited data for 
Rs 1099?

What is my conclusion finally?
For a data user, Reliance Jio is not impressive. If the usage is more than 1 GB per month, then the Rs 149 pack should not even be considered because it has only 300 MB. In the next pack, Jio offers 4 GB data for Rs 499 which is not revolutionary, but since it says night time is unlimited, I think it can be called "evolutionary". But still that is not such a great incentive to switch. 
In the next plan which costs Rs 999, it offers only 10 GB, whereas BSNL gives me unlimited data for almost the same price. 

That's about my personal requirements. Now let's look at the overall benefit for the masses.

The only major advantage for the masses is the unlimited voice calling which can be availed for Rs 149 per month. In today's scenario, most of the mobile users, especially among the working class, are actually prepaid users with free lifetime validity connections, upon which they regularly recharge Rs 20-30 which usually lasts for almost a month for them. For example, I personally know many taxi drivers, vegetable vendors, mechanics etc who hardly make outgoing calls. Even if they make an outgoing call, it would not last for more than a minute. Such people tend to use only Rs 30-50 talktime per month, for which only Rs 50 topup recharge is sufficient. (Such recharges have unlimited validity). 
Now, if they must go for Jio just because the free voice calling is tempting, then it means they must shell out Rs 149, which lapses after  28 days (It has 28 days validity), after which they must again recharge Rs 149 and so on. For someone who is used to topup of Rs 20-30 per month (and that too on a need basis), such a mandatory cost of Rs 149/month sounds very expensive. That translates to around 149*12 = Rs 1800 per annum, compared to their existing habit of regular topups which might come up to a total of just 20*12 = Rs 240 per annum which is sufficient for their practical purposes. 
That's a whopping 6 times higher, just for unlimited voice calling, whether you really do unlimited calling or not.  

So, as we can see, the only upside is unlimited voice, and not data. Even the unlimited voice for Rs 149 sounds high for the majority who are happy with their Rs 20-30 topup once in every 20-30 days. 

Hence, it is difficult to categorize Reliance Jio as a revolutionary data service, but it can be a good voice service if one is into chattering  regularly for 1 hour outgoing call every day. 

Now that we have realized that the Jio plans are not revolutionary, can we atleast call it evolutionary? Not really. By claiming itself as a path for Digital India & provide internet to the masses, it might actually end up becoming popular only for its unlimited voice, and since voice services are considered "backward", it is certainly not evolutionary. 

This way, Jio, according to my analysis is chalking out the vision of "Analog India" (voice), but not "Digital India" (data).

9/5/16, 7:50 AM - ANUPAM: Sources said Sacked AAP minister Sandeep Kumar, holding passport number K649210, made two trips to the US‚Äîfirst with his pregnant wife on April 22 by Kuwait Airways and the second by Air India on June 24.
‚ÄúThe fact that his wife was pregnant was not disclosed to the authorities concerned of the US Embassy in New Delhi,‚Äù they said. When Kumar went to the US for the second time in an official capacity, the state government said it was ‚Äúnot informed and this information needs to be verified‚Äù.
Documents in the possession of The Sunday Standard show Kumar misused his official position to make the pregnancy of his adored wife‚Äîhe had confessed to touching her feet every morning before he went to work‚Äîeasier. The ministry remained headless until May 6 when he returned from the Big Apple. On May 3, while in New York, he summoned his personal secretary Praveen Singh in the Delhi government to fly to the US on the taxpayers‚Äô money. Three days later, he returned to Delhi and directed the PS to admit his wife in Elmhurst Hospital. On June 10, she gave birth to a baby boy, Rudra Pratap Singh. A copy of the child‚Äôs birth certificate proclaiming him to be a US citizen is with this paper.
9/5/16, 7:50 AM - ANUPAM: many Indians and collected donations and other valuables in the name of the party,‚Äù said sources. On July 10, Sandeep, Ritu, baby Rudra and Praveen returned as one happy family to Delhi by Air India

9/5/16, 9:58 AM - ANUPAM: http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html
9/5/16, 9:59 AM - ANUPAM: But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. ‚Äò‚ÄòSome teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,‚Äô‚Äô said Anita Woolley, the study‚Äôs lead author. ‚Äò‚ÄòOther groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone‚Äôs relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.‚Äô‚Äô
As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‚Äò‚Äòequality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.‚Äô‚Äô On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‚Äò‚ÄòAs long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,‚Äô‚Äô Woolley said. ‚Äò‚ÄòBut if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.‚Äô‚Äô
Second, the good teams all had high ‚Äò‚Äòaverage social sensitivity‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äî a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people‚Äôs eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling ‚Äî an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley‚Äôs experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

9/5/16, 4:40 PM - Maaruti: A perfect example for the dilemma we often face in any decision making.

A group of children were playing near two railway tracks, one still in use while the other not.

Only one child played on the unused track, the rest on the operational track.

A train is coming, and you are just beside the track interchange. You can make the train change its course to the unused track and save most of the kids.

However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the unused track would be sacrificed.

Or would you rather let the train go its way?

Let's take a pause to think what kind of decision we could make................

have u thought enough !!!!

Most people might choose to divert the course of the train, and sacrifice only one child. Save most of the children at the expense of only one child was rational decision most people would make, morally and emotionally.

But, have you ever thought that the child chose to play on the unused track had in fact made the right decision to play at a safe place?

Nevertheless, he had to be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who chose to play where the danger was.

This kind of dilemma happens around us everyday. In the office, community, in politics and especially in a democratic society, the RIGHT is often sacrificed for the interest of the majority, no matter how foolish or ignorant the majority are, and how far-sighted and knowledgeable the wise are.

The great critic Leo Velski Julian who told the story said he would not try to change the course of the train because he believed that the kids playing on the operational track were aware that the track was still in use, and that they would run away when they hear the train's sirens.

Now, If the train was diverted, that lone child would definitely die because he never expects that a train could come over on the unused track!

Further, that track was not in use probably because it was not safe. If the train was diverted to such a track, we may put the lives of all passengers on board at stake! And in our attempt to save few kids thinking that the train may run over them, we might end up sacrificing hundreds of people.

While we are all aware that life is full of tough decisions that need to be made, we may not realize that hasty decision may not always be the right one.

and what's popular isn't always Right."

9/6/16, 6:49 PM - ANUPAM: The pick-up in corporate performance and the de-bottlenecking of stressed sectors in India is likely to be gradual, hurting Union Bank‚Äôs asset quality,‚Äù the rating agency noted in its assessment. ‚ÄúThe stress has pushed up the bank‚Äôs non-performing ratio.‚Äù

Right now, neither¬†India‚Äôs economy¬†or banks are in the greatest shape. Growth slowed from 7.9 per cent in the first quarter to 7.1 per cent in the second (and according to the ‚Äî probably more accurate ‚Äî methodology the government used to employ, the first-quarter figure was just over 4.3 per cent).

9/8/16, 6:58 AM - Pankaj Jha: Hirachuni, a small village, about 23 kms from Jamshedpur in East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, will get its own Facebook page, WhatsApp group and its residents will get individual mail ids as a part of the Digital India campaign to promote digital literacy in remote places.

According to the 2011 census, the village has a population 300 living in 60 houses with majority of them having access to internet.

‚ÄúInitially, we have identified a small village Hirachuni, near National Highway 33, under Jamshedpur block as majority of the population were literate and have the facility to access internet‚Äù, district public relation officer of east Singhbhum, Sanjay Kumar, said.

Kumar met the villagers, including present and former gram pradhan, ward members, representative of Pragya Kendra and youths and explained the plans in detail.

The e-mail ids will be prefixed with the village‚Äôs name, followed by the villagers‚Äô names. For example in hirachuni.XYZ@gmail.com, XYZ represents the name of a particular villager.

The village will also have its own Facebook account - Digital Hirachuni - a Whatsapp group and blog with a similar name, Kumar said.

Majority of villagers possess smartphones and thus promotion of the scheme won‚Äôt be difficult, Kumar said.

The village has four mobile towers and thus connectivity won‚Äôt be a problem too, Kumar added.

9/11/16, 2:44 PM - Pankaj Jha: there is no formula for survival, except unconditional acceptance of life, and what it brings
9/11/16, 3:32 PM - ANUPAM: As a person deeply interested in automation of medicine and working in fringes..here are my 2 cents..
1. Wherever the input variables are clean ( like in clean excel sheets, structured data most likely to be seen in banking,IT )..machines are likely to take over..

In medicine unfortunately input variables are not clean ..and require an interpreter to elicit if these are substantial..
Eg. How would a robot or a program judge it is dengue waali bechaini ya myocardial infarction waali bechaini ya tharak waali bechaini..
Very difficult..
It is much easier to sort and analyse even unstructured documents rather than humans.

2. Even where places where structured inputs are in place like electronic medical records, bulk of decisions are taken by humans as 80% of things going on in even hospitals is cognitive,unstructured and hence undocumented.

In US already a debate is happening that whether costs incurred in electronic medical records is worth it.

In absence of relevant data,automation or pattern recognition hence is a mirage.

3. Performing procedures is even more tough because human veins unlike an Intel*86,or AMD or a Mac , Dont have any specific trajectory..counter n yada yada...

Medicine traditional has been most resistant to change and probably this is the way it shall remain..
9/11/16, 3:32 PM - ANUPAM: Traditionally
9/11/16, 3:36 PM - ANUPAM: Now think about this ECG has been around for 100 years now, it is very structured, still computers haven't been able to interpret it properly despite claims to contrary..in personal experience about 60-65% sensitivity of computers making a correct diagnosis about ischemia with modern state of art AI..
Hmm..so there..
9/11/16, 3:40 PM - ANUPAM: A Fourier pattern repeating signal on a graph paper should have been easy picking and  fair game for machines and robots and computers , except that it isn't..
So in general these things plus the fact that most docs are not exactly machine friendly will make automation tough..compared to nerds and geeks who like to do things just because they want to play with machinesm
9/11/16, 4:22 PM - Maaruti: Upar se input Bhi to Itna diversified hai
9/11/16, 6:10 PM - Pankaj Jha: Sir u have a point but u should also consider increasing rate of Robotic Surgeries in almost all fields which are far far more sophisticated and human intervention backed process
9/11/16, 6:30 PM - ANUPAM: Robotic surgeries as yet are only in few specific domains..and they are done by humans..think of it as human sitting inside a robot..not a robot itself..
9/11/16, 6:35 PM - ANUPAM: Plus think about we all heard that everything would be laparoscopic right..?..ever since laparoscopy came into its own in 1970s.( first lap was done in 1901)..still majority of operations in India are open..

Limited point I am trying to make is robotics and automation is not going to change medicine in a major way as it has done in IT or as mobile phone have done for normal humans
9/11/16, 6:38 PM - Pankaj Jha: If u compare robotic surgery ration with robotic banking or shop floor operations u will be amazed
9/11/16, 6:38 PM - Pankaj Jha: If u compare robotic surgery ratio with robotic banking or shop floor operations u will be amazed
9/11/16, 6:39 PM - Pankaj Jha: Yes ur point that it would not have greater impact sounds logical
9/11/16, 6:42 PM - Kashif: One important point: robotic surgery is actually robot assisted surgery. You still need an operator.

9/25/16, 8:35 PM - Pankaj Jha: *Philosophy of Mahabharata*

It is said in the texts that 80% of the fighting male population of the civilization was wiped out in the eighteen days Mahabharata war.

Sanjay, at the end of the war went to the spot where the greatest war took place; Kurukshetra.

He looked around and wondered if the war really happened, if the ground beneath him had soaked all that blood, if the great Pandavas and Krishna stood where he stood.

‚ÄúYou will never know the truth about that!‚Äù said an aging soft voice.

Sanjay turned around to find an Old man in saffron robes appearing out of a column of dust. 

‚ÄúI know you are here to find out about the Kurukshetra war, but *you cannot know about that war till you know what the real war is about*.‚Äù the Old man said enigmatically.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù 

*The Mahabharata is an Epic, a ballad, perhaps a reality, but definitely a philosophy*.

The Old man smiled luring Sanjay into more questions.

‚ÄúCan you tell me what the philosophy is then?‚Äù 
Sanjay requested.

Sure, began the Old man. 

*The Pandavas are nothing but your five senses*, 
sight, 
smell, 
taste, 
touch & 
sound..., 

and do you know what the *Kauravas* are?
 he asked narrowing his eyes. 

 *The Kauravas are the hundred vices that attack your senses everyday but you can fight them*... and do you know how?

Sanjay shook his head again.

‚ÄúWhen Krishna rides your chariot!‚Äù
 
The Old man smiled brighter and Sanjay gasped at that gem of insight.

*Krishna is your inner voice, your soul, your guiding light and if you let your life in his hands you have nothing to worry*.

Sanjay was stupefied but came around quickly with another question.

‚ÄúThen *why are Dronacharya and Bhishma fighting for the Kauravas, if they are vices*?‚Äù

The Old man nodded.
It just means that as you grow up, your perception of your elders change.
*The elders who you thought were perfect in your growing up years are not all that perfect. They have faults. And one day you will have to decide if they are for your good or your bad. Then you may also realize that you may have to fight them for the good. It is the hardest part of growing up and that is why the Geeta is important*.

Sanjay slumped down on the ground, not because he was tired but because he could understand and was struck by  the enormity of it all. 

 *What about Karna*? He whispered.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said the Old man. ‚ÄúYou have saved the best for last. *Karna is the brother to your senses, he is desire, he is a part of you but stands with the vices. He feels wronged and makes excuses for being with the vices as your desire does all the time.*

 *Does your desire not give you excuses to embrace vices*?‚Äù

Sanjay nodded silently. He looked at the ground, consumed with a million thoughts, trying to put everything together and then when he looked up the Old man was gone.... 
disappeared in the column of dust.........
leaving behind the great philosophy of Life.

9/27/16, 5:05 PM - ANUPAM: Bal Kishan Bansal was Director-General of Corporate Affairs before he was arrested in July by the CBI on charges of corruption. The CBI said it caught him accepting Rs nine lakh in cash from a pharmaceutical company that wanted to buy its way out of an investigation for illegal business practices.
A case was registered under the provisions of the Corruption Act on allegations that Bansal had been dealing with matters related to violations committed by Mumbai-based pharmaceutical company Elder Pharmaceuticals. It was alleged that Bansal demanded Rs 20 lakh for sparing it any investigation. According to NDTV , the CBI had searched the house and found Rs 60 lakh in cash, 20 property papers and details of 60 bank accounts.
Bansal's wife Satyabala, 58, and 28-year-old daughter Neha committed suicide in July right after Bansal was sent to CBI custody.

During 2nd year he proposed.

It was 2 late as d girl was already married.

10/10/16, 8:40 PM - ‚Ä™+91 87979 60007‚Ä¨: *1. Kamasutra says : If you suck one nipple, the women herself offers the other one. And that was the origin of "buy one get one free"!*

*2. Did you ever notice: everything on a woman's upper body starts with a "B". Blouse, Bra, Bikini, Boobs and lower body with a "P" Peticoat, panties, pussy... That's origin of "BP"!*

*3. Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself. Moral: In life no one helps you once you're fucked.*

*4. Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.*

*5. What is the difference between frustration and satisfaction? What the Fuck! and What a Fuck!*

*6. 3 people having sex is a threesome, 2 is a twosome. So next time someone calls you 'HANDSOME', don't take it as a compliment!*

*7. Life is like a dick, sometimes it becomes hard for no reason.*

*8. Practical thought: A husband is supposed to make his wife's panties wet, not her eyes. A wife is supposed to make her husband's dick hard, not his life..!*

*9. When a lady is pregnant, all her friends touch her stomach ad say "Congrats!". But none of them come and touch the man's Penis and say "Well done!".*

*Moral: Hard work is never appreciated: Only result matters.*

*Dont delete it unless forward it to a grp of naughty Friends*

The Mayor of London, England,was very worried about a plague of pigeons in the City Centre.
 He could not remove the pigeons from the city. 
All of London was full of pigeon poop, the people of London could not walk on the pavements, or drive on the roads.
It was costing a fortune to keep the streets and pavements clean.

One day a man came to the Town Hall and offered the Mayor a proposition. 
'I can rid your beautiful city of its plague of pigeons without any cost to the city. But, you must promise not to ask me any questions. Or, you can pay me one million pounds to ask one question.'

The mayor considered the offer briefly and accepted the free proposition.

The next day the man climbed to the top of the Nelson's Column, opened his coat, and released a blue pigeon. 
The blue pigeon circled in the air and flew up into the bright blue London sky. All the pigeons in London saw the blue pigeon and gathered up in the air behind the bird.
 The London pigeons followed the blue pigeon as she flew eastwards out of the city.

The next day the blue pigeon returned completely alone to the man on top of Nelson's Column. 
The Mayor was very impressed.
 He felt the man and the blue pigeon had performed a wonderful miraculous service to rid London of the plague of pigeons.

Even though the man with the pigeon had charged nothing, the mayor presented him with a check for 1 million pounds and told the man that, indeed, he did have a question to ask and even though they had agreed to no fee and the man had rid the city of pigeons, he decided to pay the 1 million just to get to ask ONE question.

The man accepted the money and told the mayor to ask his ONE question.

The mayor asked:-

```'Do you have a blue Pakistani?'```

10/20/16, 3:47 PM - ANUPAM: US-based C Edmonds Allen, whose earlier complaints had led to investigation of arms dealer
Abhishek Verma (he's out on bail now), has written to the Prime Minister's Office that Varun Gandhi , BJP MP, has been "honey trapped and compromised" by Verma.
In a September 16 letter sent to the PMO , Allen alleges Gandhi is being blackmailed by the arms dealer. Allen has provided a CD with several dozen photographs.
10/20/16, 3:48 PM - ANUPAM: Varun Gandhi ki CD ,MMS share karo
10/20/16, 3:49 PM - ANUPAM: Gandhi is no longer on the defence consultative committee and senior leaders in BJP said documents or information of classified nature are not usually shared with members of the parliamentary committee.
Allen was earlier an escrow agent for Verma and had shared several hundred documents with Indian authorities in 2012 that led to several cases being registered against the arms dealer, including one under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), as sensitive defence ministry documents were leaked.

10/22/16, 1:37 PM - ANUPAM: Allen‚Äôs letter is said to be accompanied by a compact disc containing hundreds of intimate photos of Gandhi, collected since 2002.
Varun on his part has squarely denied the claims, for lack of any evidence, and has threatened a law-suit for defamation. He claims to have met Abhishek Verma only during his post-graduation days in 2002, and not after that.
As far as the pictures are concerned, they are indeed highly explicit, and we can‚Äôt publish them. Allen has claimed that these pictures were authentic and not digitally or otherwise tampered. They do appear authentic, but this should be left to forensic experts, which is why we are not publishing them.
However, we can talk about it for sure. In the pictures accessed by OpIndia.com, Varun Gandhi looks inebriated, to say the least, and in compromising position with a female. In some pictures, his eyes even seem closed. This is crucial since the pictures seem to have been clicked by a third person, using a high resolution camera. Remember, these pictures are from more than 10 years ago, when selfies weren‚Äôt a thing nor were sex-tapes.
So from the photos, some questions arise: Was Gandhi heavily under the influence of some drugs or intoxicants? Does this explain why his eyes seem closed? Does this also explain why he ‚Äúallowed‚Äù a third person to click pictures of him in compromising positions? Was he indeed a victim of blackmailing but chose not to go to police about it?
Whatever the case maybe, Varun is in a soup. What makes matters worse for him is that even BJP has
instructed its spokespersons not to defend him. They have either kept mum or have said they wouldn‚Äôt like to compromise with national security.

10/24/16, 11:07 AM - Maaruti: Iski jaroorat Nahi padegi
10/24/16, 11:12 AM - ANUPAM: Thackeray's were goonda used by congress to finish thug communist unions in bombay..to prevent bombay from becoming Kolkata..

Remember how many trade union leaders were killed by shiv sena in between 1970-84..

Congress government then kept watching and brokering as BJP is doing now
10/24/16, 11:15 AM - ANUPAM: After sometime as every goonda decides, why not become a leader..
10/24/16, 11:16 AM - ANUPAM: Regarding usool..
Goonde ka pehla usool hota hai ki uska koi usool nahi hota
10/24/16, 11:18 AM - Maaruti: With patronage of Sunil Dutt
10/24/16, 11:19 AM - Maaruti: Mera Naam Hai Bulla , Main rakhta hoon khulla
10/24/16, 11:29 AM - ANUPAM: Communists were very powerful in bombay..
Progressive writer association me kaifi aazmi, janisaar akhtar( javed akhtar ke daddy),majrooh sultanpuri..aur bade saare the ..

Majrooh wrote.."Commonwealth ka das yeh
Nehru ,. Aur tabahi laaney na payee. Maar ley saathi, Jaaney na paaye.."
10/24/16, 11:30 AM - ANUPAM: Aaj Freedom of expression ka Rona Rone waale, aur nehru ji ka gaana gaane waale Jaan le..Majrooh was jailed for writing this on orders of nehru for a month.
10/24/16, 11:31 AM - ANUPAM: Congress figured that communists would take over bombay n eventually Maharashtra like they did in west Bengal...
10/24/16, 11:32 AM - ANUPAM: So they hired non-state actor thugs like bal Thackeray..
10/24/16, 11:33 AM - ANUPAM: Only one credit of These thugs Thackerays, prevented bombay from becoming communist dustbin like calcutta
10/24/16, 11:35 AM - Pankaj Jha: We all agree our only request is We should not get lectured on Nationalism by the likes of chutiya Thackreys
10/24/16, 11:41 AM - ANUPAM: Democracy me sabko lecture dene ka haq hai aur hame uska mazaak udaane ka..
Only thing is by playing broker in official capacity devendra fadnavis has showed he officially gives sanctuary to those thugs
10/24/16, 11:41 AM - ANUPAM: Baaki to umar Khalid bhi deshbhakti ka lecture deta hai JNU me
10/24/16, 11:49 AM - ANUPAM: A political party speaks in multiple voices
Congress speaks through digvijay, nirupam chidambram and rahul..

BJP speaks through Thackeray,togadia,sadhvi prachi,modi..and bhakts..

You might hate to be branded with lumpens..but every party has them..
10/24/16, 11:51 AM - ANUPAM: However while earlier congress chiefs like Indira and rajiv never did chhichorapanthi...Sonia and rahul have repeatedly shown they can go to any extent( even compromising national security ) for votes
10/24/16, 12:48 PM - Satish: Pom are you justifying Thackreys
10/24/16, 12:49 PM - Satish: Same justification is given by many people for shahbuddin
10/24/16, 12:49 PM - Satish: Remember he killed Ajit Sarkar
10/24/16, 12:49 PM - Satish: Communist
10/24/16, 12:49 PM - Satish: Lalu killed Chandrasekhar JNU communist
10/24/16, 12:49 PM - Satish: Why change stand and switch sides between Bihar and Maharastra
10/24/16, 12:50 PM - Satish: Criminal is Criminal...Not your criminal my criminal
10/24/16, 12:50 PM - ANUPAM: I am not justifying Thackeray. He is a criminal.
10/24/16, 12:50 PM - Satish: I am happy at demise of SP...Only for that reason...atleast Akhilesh has guts to loose elections than to ally with Criminals
10/24/16, 12:51 PM - Satish: Then all good
10/24/16, 12:51 PM - Satish: We are aligned
10/24/16, 12:51 PM - ANUPAM: Dev fadnavis should be ashamed of brokering for a criminal.
10/24/16, 12:51 PM - Satish: Absolute agreement Jha ji
10/24/16, 12:52 PM - Satish: Absolutely...Whether Fadnavis Nitish brokerage for criminals is wrong
10/24/16, 12:52 PM - Satish: The day Nitish seen with Shahbuddin...He might be meeting in dark rooms...but of in Public glare...
10/24/16, 12:52 PM - Satish: He should be done with...
10/24/16, 12:54 PM - ANUPAM: Remember shiv sena made a similar threat to shah rukh khan at time of my name is khan..
They were ignored and movie did well..
10/24/16, 12:54 PM - ANUPAM: I am talking perhaps after 26/11
10/24/16, 12:56 PM - ANUPAM: Baaki mujhe kisi ko deshdrohi aur use mujhme chutiya kehne ka lecture dene ka adhikar hai
10/24/16, 12:57 PM - ANUPAM: ..hat baat me doosre ko sanghi bolne waalon ko hi ab anti-national bolne pe takleef
10/24/16, 12:58 PM - Satish: Jarur hai...Mujhe bhi
10/24/16, 12:58 PM - Satish: Sanghi ka Opposite Pseudosecular
10/24/16, 12:59 PM - ANUPAM: Freedom of expression means I have right to abuse you and vice versa..

Sab se jyaada dikkat isse takht-o-taJ pe baithne waale logon ko hui
10/24/16, 12:59 PM - Satish: All these Sena is Chutiya...Only Sena which matters and we all should take pride is Indian Army
10/24/16, 1:00 PM - ANUPAM: Ideally bhagwaan ko bhi gaali dene ka adhikar hona chahiye..but woh kamjori hai
10/24/16, 1:00 PM - ANUPAM: Hamaare kanoon ki
10/24/16, 1:01 PM - ANUPAM: Prophet ko gali do to kamlesh tiwari andar, guru rehman rahim ko do to comedian kiku sharda andar, Ram bhagwan ko do to owaisi Ndar
10/24/16, 1:01 PM - ANUPAM: Andar
10/24/16, 1:04 PM - ANUPAM: Dikkat hai ki guru rehman rahim bolta hai ki jab prophet aur Ram ko koi gaali nahi De sakta to mujhme Kaise doge, main bhi to kitno ka bhagwaan hoon
10/24/16, 1:06 PM - ANUPAM: Jaise hi kisi organisation Ne apna naam sena rakha to special scrutiny honi chahiye
10/24/16, 1:07 PM - ANUPAM: However Indians in general Dont want to offend any Gids
10/24/16, 1:07 PM - ANUPAM: Gods
10/24/16, 1:11 PM - Maaruti: Like Jaish e Mohammad

10/26/16, 8:44 AM - ANUPAM: Chakraborthy adds, "My direct question to Attlee was that since Gandhi's Quit India movement had tapered off quite some time ago and in 1947 no such new compelling situation had arisen that would necessitate a hasty British departure, why did they had to leave?"
"In his reply Attlee cited several reasons, the principal among them being the erosion of loyalty to the British crown among the Indian army and Navy personnel as a result of the military activities of Netaji," Justice Chakraborthy says.
That's not all. Chakraborthy adds, "Toward the end of our discussion I asked Attlee what was the extent of Gandhi's influence upon the British decision to quit India. Hearing this question, Attlee's lips became twisted in a sarcastic smile as he slowly chewed out the word, m-i-n-i-m-a-l!"

10/28/16, 9:54 PM - Satish: Low base was for all earlier chief ministers
10/28/16, 9:54 PM - ANUPAM: Bihar was very well governed past 10 years..why did it hit a plateau
10/28/16, 9:55 PM - Satish: India is growing also due to low base vs US vs Germany vs China
10/28/16, 9:55 PM - Satish: You don't say that logic there...

10/28/16, 9:56 PM - ANUPAM: NCR IS NCR
10/28/16, 9:57 PM - Satish: Bihar and UP are sick due to caste politics..
10/28/16, 9:57 PM - ANUPAM: Germany had great industrial culture across rivers
10/28/16, 9:57 PM - ANUPAM: Geography class tenth 101
10/28/16, 9:57 PM - Satish: UP and Bihar has Rivers...
10/28/16, 9:57 PM - Satish: Pom it's not 101
10/28/16, 9:59 PM - ANUPAM: Yaar we will talk after ten years..
Why is no body willing to put industries in Bihar along ganga after ten years of high growth from low base
10/28/16, 9:59 PM - Satish: Lest talk different after 10 years ...

10/28/16, 10:01 PM - ANUPAM: You need mindset of Bihar,u.p. to be like Gujarati,Maha and Tamil nadu...
10/28/16, 10:02 PM - ANUPAM: No such mindset..
10/28/16, 10:02 PM - Satish: Criminal belts like Muzzfarnagar Siwan Gorakhpur
10/28/16, 10:02 PM - Satish: I can't commment

10/28/16, 10:04 PM - ANUPAM: Well yes. That is why I Dont bet on myself opening a business. Why should I burn myself over a thing,where I m least efficient. You are good ,you can do it. But trapped in family chores.
10/28/16, 10:05 PM - Satish: Bhai let's see...what future holds..

10/28/16, 10:28 PM - Satish: If Maruti can hope to open clinic only if BJP forms givt
10/28/16, 10:29 PM - ANUPAM: Hope is like adrenaline...can.resuscitate a dead and kill of ventricular fibrillation
10/28/16, 10:29 PM - Satish: I can hope in 10 yrs in Bihar or UP
10/28/16, 10:29 PM - Satish: Whoever is in Govt
10/28/16, 10:30 PM - ANUPAM: And too much hope if taken se4iously can drive mad also..üòã
Bas modiji sane rahein..üòã
10/28/16, 10:30 PM - ANUPAM: Seriously
10/28/16, 10:31 PM - Satish: No poltician is sane..
10/28/16, 10:31 PM - Satish: They can never be...Else they will be lazy

10/28/16, 10:35 PM - ANUPAM: Anyways each of us has our blind spots..
But I seriously think regional leaders have No national interest in mind..
And in Congress there are many good leaders..but Sonia,rahul are inept,have no skin in game and anti-hindu unlike rajiv and sonia
10/28/16, 10:35 PM - ANUPAM: Think jayalaitha and mamta almost sabotaged Bangladesh and our relations with sri lanka
10/28/16, 10:36 PM - ANUPAM: Jabki they are so called popular leaders
10/28/16, 10:36 PM - ANUPAM: Unlike rajiv and indira
10/28/16, 10:36 PM - ANUPAM: And kejriwal hahahaha
10/28/16, 10:38 PM - ANUPAM: Nitish kumar didn't investigate the bhatkal guy ..amazing

10/28/16, 10:40 PM - ANUPAM: Even modi aligned with PDP..but then got burhan wani killed..and now people accuse PDP of towing BJP line..
Many think BJP aligned with PDP to kill mehbooba's popularity
10/28/16, 10:40 PM - Satish: Is now in BJP
10/28/16, 10:40 PM - Satish: Many times I saw him on TV
10/28/16, 10:40 PM - ANUPAM: Dont worry,he will be screwed..just remain a peripheral leader
10/28/16, 10:40 PM - Satish: Cash flow...is big thing..
10/28/16, 10:41 PM - ANUPAM: Unlike digvijay saying 26/11 is RSS hit job and fake strike niupam
10/28/16, 10:41 PM - Satish: Give big buckets of cash...and siphon it out somehow...Now don't ask proof. ..
10/28/16, 10:41 PM - ANUPAM: Nirupam..
These are main leaders of congress
10/28/16, 10:41 PM - Satish: Every poltical party needs fund
10/28/16, 10:41 PM - Satish: Easiest is this way..
10/28/16, 10:41 PM - ANUPAM: Amazing..and what chidambaram did with ishrat jahan
10/28/16, 10:42 PM - Satish: Nirupam is basically from RSS ideology...
10/28/16, 10:42 PM - Satish: Now last 10 years congressi
10/28/16, 10:42 PM - Satish: Chidambaram is Chitiya
10/28/16, 10:42 PM - Satish: Chutiya
10/28/16, 10:42 PM - ANUPAM: Maa ki bhi dalali kar ke paise as sakte hai..kidney beach ke bhi daaktar kamata hai..there are limits
10/28/16, 10:42 PM - Satish: Digvijay is Dogala Raja
10/28/16, 10:43 PM - ANUPAM: Chidamaram was home minister and digvijay was general secretary of last dispensation
10/28/16, 10:43 PM - ANUPAM: Bhai jab Ghar hi safe nahi to deal kar ke kya
10/28/16, 10:44 PM - Satish: Don't worry 10 year down the line you will discuss
10/28/16, 10:44 PM - Satish: Rafale
10/28/16, 10:44 PM - Satish: That's called politics..
10/28/16, 10:44 PM - ANUPAM: Again scoot and shoot..can give you point by point rebuttal of rafale deal
10/28/16, 10:44 PM - Satish: Media will change....New industrials alliances will happen....foreign funding will change..

10/28/16, 10:45 PM - ANUPAM: I said that vajpayee saved rajiv in bofors
10/28/16, 10:46 PM - ANUPAM: But now there is too much scrutiny
10/28/16, 10:46 PM - Satish: Why?
10/28/16, 10:46 PM - Satish: He saved
10/28/16, 10:46 PM - ANUPAM: You point out specific allegation in revised rafale instead of blindly alleging
10/28/16, 10:46 PM - Satish: So that when congress is in power...No problems
10/28/16, 10:46 PM - ANUPAM: Like all doctors are corrupt
10/28/16, 10:47 PM - Satish: That's biggest defence deal
10/28/16, 10:47 PM - Satish: And I said 10 year down the line suspicion will emerge
10/28/16, 10:47 PM - Satish: Proof kabhi kuch nahi hoga
10/28/16, 10:47 PM - ANUPAM: So conspiracy theory..
10/28/16, 10:47 PM - Satish: I am no one for theorey
10/28/16, 10:48 PM - ANUPAM: Shoot and scoot
10/28/16, 10:48 PM - Satish: Poltics is always run on allegations and promsises
10/28/16, 10:48 PM - Satish: And it will be always....
10/28/16, 10:48 PM - Satish: Don't expect polticians to pay fair to each other ...
10/28/16, 10:50 PM - ANUPAM: Ek chor bolta hai doosra to dacoit hai pehle use pakdo..
But that is not a defence. 
There are different punishments for murder and theft even though both are morally wrong
10/28/16, 10:50 PM - Satish: Yes
10/28/16, 10:51 PM - Satish: <Media omitted>
10/28/16, 10:51 PM - Satish: These are only pleasurable fingers.
10/28/16, 10:51 PM - Satish: Rest are always pointed at wrong things of others...
10/28/16, 10:52 PM - ANUPAM: Understand this if chidambaram and digvijay were in US their carriers as politicians would have been finished..if they alleged 9/11 was inside job..
10/28/16, 10:55 PM - ANUPAM: Enough of bakar good night..

10/29/16, 12:21 PM - ANUPAM: US supreme court has banned race based quota for blacks many times as a mode of affirmative action because it was discriminatory against whites..As a result Indians have gained..because Indians tend to score disproportionately well in aptitude tests

10/29/16, 2:48 PM - ANUPAM: Munger Multan collaboration in Malda
10/29/16, 2:49 PM - ANUPAM: According to the arrested terrorist, Pakistani tribal gunsmiths clandestinely visited Malda to train gunsmiths from Munger, who set up base in the border district to make AK-22 assault rifles. These weapons were then smuggled into Bangladesh via Chapainawabgunj. The NIA investigators suspect the Pakistanis who conducted the training were from the Darra Adam Khel community that resides in a village located between Peshawar and Kohat. The community is believed to regularly help the Taliban in duplicating modern weapons.¬†

"We aren't sure yet but the language they mentioned is spoken in and around the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan where the village is located," a senior NIA officer said. Bangladesh has already alleged that the weapons used in the Holey Artisan bakery attack were sourced from across the border. The country's counterterrorism and trans-national crime chief, Monirul Islam, had categorically mentioned Munger in this connection. Thereafter, Bihar police had launched an investigation into the matter.¬†

"The Bihar police in a communique to Bengal police has confirmed that the arms manufacturers and smugglers had set up units in Malda and other places in Bengal," an STF officer said

10/29/16, 9:12 PM - Kashif: Very nice diction of the poem by zeeshan. He makes the words come alive . It made me feel as if I was walking through the streets of delhi with street vendors and restaurants.
10/29/16, 9:18 PM - Satish: Just that all should know
10/29/16, 9:19 PM - Satish: Zeeshan the poet who worked in Raanjhana and Tanu weds Manu is Kashif's goof friend...
10/29/16, 9:35 PM - ANUPAM: Really..
Zeeshan is not the poet though, but such a deep baritone and an evocative voice like piyush mishra and amitabh bachhan .He should work more and do quality work!!

To think it was written by nazeer akbarabadi around 1750-60..amazing as if 350 years have passed and everything has changed, yet nothing has..amazing
10/29/16, 9:36 PM - ANUPAM: https://youtu.be/aGyPu0REy00

10/29/16, 9:51 PM - Kashif: Yes zeeshan is my very good friends brother shahaan. In fact shahaan was more naturally talented than zeeshan but never had the dream to become actor. Instead he became a PhD in computing and now works in monash university. Whereas zeeshan followed his dreams and became an actor and famous too.
10/29/16, 10:11 PM - ANUPAM: Very nice. Inspires all of us to follow our dreams.üëç

10/30/16, 7:35 AM - Satish: Is Rakesh Christian?
10/30/16, 7:37 AM - Satish: He is Hindu Punjabi
10/30/16, 7:38 AM - Satish: Waise Happy Diwali...to all Hindu Muslim Sikh Issai!!!!!
10/30/16, 7:42 AM - Satish: Rakesh Maria is best Cop ...putting allegation on him is unfair atleast if coming from Paadnavis
10/30/16, 7:42 AM - ANUPAM: OK seems wrong info..?..
He is from film family though..peter was in TV network
10/30/16, 7:43 AM - Satish: He is the man who solved 1992 blasts...For more refer to Black Friday
10/30/16, 7:43 AM - ANUPAM: But it clearly emerges,he was trying to save peter..for whatever reasons..
10/30/16, 7:43 AM - Satish: Pom your and my family was from Coal India...are you involved in Coal Scam
10/30/16, 7:43 AM - ANUPAM: True,and presided over 26/11..bad leadership.
10/30/16, 7:44 AM - Satish: We must honor and respect good deeds and not link all to family or religion biases we all have...
10/30/16, 7:44 AM - ANUPAM: He was specifically blamed by constable kamte's wife that he threw him to wolves..and was not hands on..

10/30/16, 7:47 AM - Satish: And not put him in Christian bigot or media family bigot...unless proven otherwose

I regret for my fellow christian remark.
10/30/16, 7:49 AM - ANUPAM: Sharad pawar
10/30/16, 7:53 AM - ANUPAM: Maria also met lalit modi,even without official brief. He likes to be in limelight. Or appears to have a hidden interest in many affairs. A very sharp man no doubt, but too clever by half.
10/30/16, 7:54 AM - Satish: Trump is Modi Policies plus Kejriwal Idiosyncrasies
10/30/16, 7:54 AM - Satish: Paadnavis
10/30/16, 7:55 AM - ANUPAM: Sabse khatarnak Attention deficit

10/30/16, 7:57 AM - Satish: Fraud transactions

10/30/16, 7:58 AM - Maaruti: The thing That Black Friday was made by Anurag Kashyap should make us doubt about the role of Rakesh Maria üòàüòàüòà
10/30/16, 7:58 AM - Satish: Come on Maruti...you can doubt then all parties involved
10/30/16, 7:59 AM - Maaruti: No it's not doubt

11/2/16, 4:03 PM - ANUPAM: Two Septembers ago, I got a call from a hospital in New York. My son who was in college at the time was just diagnosed with leukaemia. Fifteen minutes later, I jumped in a car and drove all night to New York, pretty much crying and pounding the steering wheel all along the way. I called one of my partners and said, ‚ÄúI am not coming to work. I have no idea how long I‚Äôll be gone. If you need to hire someone to replace me, go right ahead.‚Äù I slept in a chair next to his bed for 42 days. Do you think for one second I regretted not going to work? I‚Äôd give up medicine and clean outhouses at Woodstock for all eternity if it meant I could help my child. People in medicine often say you can‚Äôt separate the two. I say bulls***. You just don‚Äôt know any better.
Listen, no matter how we like to hold up ourselves as the pillars of compassion, the keepers of the public wellbeing, we are just one profession out of countless others that keep our world moving. We are no more heroes than the social worker visiting homes in the projects, the farmer up at 4am to feed the cattle, the ironworker strapped to a beam on the 50th floor. We are no more a hero than the single mom working overnight as a custodian, trying to feed her kids. We are no more heroic than countless others who work in jobs they perhaps hate in order to care for and support the people they love.
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong in telling the group that medicine is just a job, but I am damn sure we in medicine are all wrong if we think our job is somehow more special and valuable than the bartender‚Äôs
11/2/16, 4:05 PM - ANUPAM: Makes an important point. Doctors tend to think that society owes something to them.
Actually it does not. Let us just work as professionals.

11/3/16, 7:54 AM - ANUPAM: http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/et-commentary/jungle-raj-in-up-what-do-crime-data-tell-us-about-the-record-of-successive-state-governments/
11/3/16, 7:54 AM - ANUPAM: A very clear picture emerges from the data. UP has had governments by either BSP or SP since May 2002, which was the last incidence when UP had a state government led by BJP. Total violent crime in UP fell dramatically from 1999 to 2003 at the rate of 16% per annum. This period coincided with the time when BJP was in power in the state.
However, since 2003 when either BSP or SP have been in power, violent crimes in UP have increased significantly at the rate of over 7% per annum. In comparison, Bihar which is the closest to UP in its record in crimes, registered increase in violent crimes at 3% per annum.
Total violent crime in UP in 2003 was lower than that in Bihar in 2003 and quite close to the levels of violent crimes in MP and Rajasthan in 2003. However, over the period 2003-14, the number of violent crimes in UP has increased at an alarming rate. None of the other Bimaru states have displayed this alarming increase in the level of violent crime. In fact, in 2014, violent crime in UP was 25% more than in Bihar.
Within the category of violent crime, two particular mastheads assume critical significance. First, murders, kidnappings and abductions represent particularly violent crimes that any civilised society must look to limit. Second, crimes against women represent another key category of violent crime that any civilised society must look to limit.
In both these categories, UP has the notorious reputation of being the leader. Moreover, UP also has achieved the dubious distinction of registering the highest increases in these crimes during the period 2003-14. This is despite the fact that crimes in both these categories registered significant declines during the period 1999-2003. None of the other Bimaru states have recorded such large increases in these crimes.

11/7/16, 9:06 AM - vishalsatish: Good Morning. We may recover from slip of the foot but a slip of tongue leaves a deep imprint. Sticks and stones can break bones- words often break relationship. The less you speak, the more you are listened. Speak less and speak sweet. Remember, your thinking leads you to anger ‚Äì not someone or something.To defuse your anger, change your thoughts.
With practice it is possible to create compassionate thoughts; then we no longer need to indulge in resentment, bitterness or dislike.Happy Monday . God Bless us.

11/8/16, 10:30 PM - ANUPAM: *why RBI is issuing ‚Çπ2000 Rupees Notes *

The Rs 2000 currency is designed keeping in mind to eradicate the black money issues using state of the art indigenous nano technology, every Rs. 2000 currency note is embedded with a *NGC (Nano GPS Chip)*

*How the embeded NGC Technology Works?*
The unique feature of the NGC is it dosent need any power source. It only acts as a signal reflector. When a Satellite sends a signal requesting location the NGC reflects back the signal from the location, giving precise location coordinates, and the serial number of the currency back to the satellite, this way every NGC embedded currency can be easily tracked & located even if it is kept 120 meters below ground level. The NGC cant be tampered with or removed without damaging the currency note

*How will this help eradicate black money menace?*
Since every NGC embeded currency can be tracked. The satellite can identify the exact amount of money stored at a certain location. If a relatively high concentration of currency is found a certain location for a longer period of time at suspicious locations other than banks & other financial institutions. The information will be passed on to the Income Tax Department for further investigation

*Just a beginning of the end of black money in India*

11/10/16, 9:25 AM - ANUPAM: There are shell companies in Mumbai and Surat, too, but Kolkata became the epicenter since the 1980s. One of the oft-cited reasons on why Kolkata flourished was because operators in the city charged less commission.

Similarly, one can import software - get a shell company in Singapore or Hong Kong to send a blank CD. "You declare that you have received a proprietary software and it costs $200,000. Even on a small scale, you can remit the money abroad. The claim is backed up by the invoice and a genuine courier," says Brar.

11/11/16, 11:46 AM - ANUPAM: As proof of democracy‚Äôs success, its champions point to disastrous alternatives, and the triumphs of the advanced economies of the West. Most of these democracies, though, made gigantic leaps in prosperity when they were not democracies or when only the educated elites could vote. Their present wealth is built on the headstart won in a period when they were not inconvenienced by democracy. Following Europe‚Äôs successful evangelisation of democracy in Asia, several nascent nations adopted an element of democracy than even the colonisers had not started with--universal suffrage. Thus India quickly created an ignorant and incompetent political class that destroyed the nation for decades

11/12/16, 2:15 PM - ANUPAM: None of points kejriwal makes is valid..
1. His facts are wrong. The deposits did not increase between September to November. Why would BJP deposit its black money in bank account so that it can be questioned. It would rather convert to gold or real estate. 


2.  Sanjeev kamboj the BJP guy just forwarded the image of 2000 rupee note that was already out in social media since almost 3-4 months. He was not sitting on wads of notes.

Kindly Dont spread rumours here.

However one thing is true.
ATMs are not working OK. People are having to wait in line. hope it improves.
11/12/16, 2:16 PM - ANUPAM: If ATMs Dont work properly..soon this good idea might turn into PR disaster for modi and nation.
11/12/16, 2:17 PM - ANUPAM: Deposits are not an issue.getting cash is.
11/12/16, 2:20 PM - ANUPAM: ATMs are 90% issue here.

11/12/16, 4:30 PM - Maaruti: <Media omitted>
11/12/16, 5:29 PM - ANUPAM: If ATMs Dont get running properly by Monday ( they are supposed to after 2 weeks, now we have been told ! )..Then we will be looking at market melt down.
At least new ATMs for dispensing new 500,2000 notes should have been in place for vending.
100 are in very less amount.

Becoming clear that bankers,babus mislead modi n jaitley as far as preparation is concerned.
11/12/16, 5:32 PM - Satish: All Bankers and Babu had tonnes of cash
11/12/16, 5:32 PM - Satish: They should be sued
11/12/16, 5:32 PM - ANUPAM: The blame has to be borne by modi ..

Now we are stuck with 100 notes (limited in amount ) and 2000( limited in use)
11/12/16, 5:32 PM - Satish: How you thought Machine will work without recalibration or upgradation of software
11/12/16, 5:33 PM - Satish: 100 and below notes are 14 percent of economy

11/12/16, 6:26 PM - Satish: An Open letter to Arvind Kejriwal by CA

to explain the probable Logic behind issuing New 2000 Rupee Note instead of 1000 Rupee Note.

Sir, I am a practising Chartered Accountant and I was very hopeful that you would support the Notification for Demonetization of Currency and was very eager for your Reaction because your very entry into Politics was for supporting any small move to reduce Black money and Corruption and after all, this was indeed a very big and bold move‚Ä¶.!

But after going through the Video released yesterday, my expectations from AAP as a Commonmen were shattered once again because I believed that a person of such stature and designation as you would spread positivity all around without any ifs and buts to make this Mega Clean-up Drive possible and rather help the common men in mitigating the problems rather than nagging about the same and hence I would like to bring to your knowledge¬†the following Points.

Point 1

As you have stated in your Video that it took full 2 days for you to understand the various aspects of the Scheme and even after consultation with various Experts , you could not basically understand the Logic of why 2000 Rupee Notes were released instead of 1000 Rupee Note, I would like to make an attempt to tender my best possible logic ( Please enlighten me if I am wrong somewhere) as follows:

Sir, let us Simply take 2 Scenarios to understand the funda !

Scenario A : If as per your suggestion , ¬†Rs. 2000 Note are not issued but¬†only New Rs. 1000 Notes are issued.

Lets say , for example Mr. X has Rs. 1,00,000/- black money in 100 Old Notes of Rs. 1000 each.

Mr. X divides those Rs. 1,00,000/- into 10 Equal Bundles, each comprising of 10 Old Notes of Rs. 1000 each and puts each Stack on a Table.
On Day 1 , in the morning Mr. X would deposit the first Bundle i.e. 10 Old Notes of Rs. 1000 valued at Rs. 10,000 into the bank and on same Day 1 in the Evening he would withdraw 10 New Notes of Rs. 1000 again valued at Rs. 10,000 and put it in the Locker in his house.

Now the real Game starts.
On Day 2 : Morning , Mr. X would deposit the second bundle of 10 Old Notes of Rs. 1000 valued at Rs. 10,000 kept on the Table. However in his books of accounts submitted to Income Tax Department, he will show that he has deposited the same 10 New Notes which was withdrawn on Day 1 : Evening ( which is actually still lying in the Locker of House )

On Day 2 : Evening , Mr. X would again withdraw 10 New Notes of Rs. 1000 valued at Rs. 10,000/- and keep the same in Locker . So at the end of Day 2, Mr. X has Rs. 80,000 on Table in Old Notes and Rs. 20,000/- in New Notes in Locker.

Now Day 3 will come in next week as limit of Rs. 20000 per week.

The same exercise shall¬†continue till Day 10 and by the end of Day 10, Mr. X shall have no Old Notes and Rs. 1,00,000 in 100 New 1000 Rupee Note in the Locker.

However, to the Income Tax Department, Mr. X has shown that he was having only Rs. 10,000/- as black money initially ( i.e. one bundle of 10 Notes of Rs. 1000 ) and he has rotated the same Rs. 10,000/- by depositing it into Bank account in the morning and withdrawing it in the evening and again redepositing the same on next day and so on.

Thus, Mr. X has paid tax only on initial Rs. 10,000 whereas he has managed to convert all his Black money of Rs. 1,00,000 into new Notes.
This Modus operandi is called Peak theory i.e. theory of rotation of same money which is accepted by most of the High Courts and Tribunals. ¬†Revenue is also helpless to catch Mr. X because the¬†above scenario can also occur in genuine cases where you withdraw money from bank to purchase something¬†and then when you think that no good deal is available, you may again deposit the same money into your bank account and are not required to pay tax again.

Scenario B : ¬†Watch what happens when PM issues New 2000 Rupee Note instead of 1000‚Ä¶.!¬†
Mr. X deposits first bundle of 10 Old Notes lying on Table in the Bank on Day 1 : Morning and then he withdraws 5 New Notes of Rs. 2000 on Day 1: Evening and keeps it in locker.
Now on Day 2 : Morning when he goes to deposit second bundle of 10 Old Notes of Rs. 1000 each and wrongly shows the Income Tax Department that he has redeposited the same money which was withdrawn on Day 1:Evening ‚Äì Bingo !!!

He is caught red handed !! because the Bank slip on Day 2 submitted to bank shows deposition of 10 Notes of Rs. 1000 each whereas the Govt knows that Mr. X could never have withdrawn on Day 1 any note of Rs. 1000 because they were never Printed !!!!
Now Isn‚Äôt it really a Master Stroke by Mr. Narendra Modi, the beloved Prime Minister of our country ?!

Sir, you have stated in the Video that if Someone gives you the logic of issuing New notes of Rs. 2000 instead of Rs. 1000, you will Salute the PM and support him in his endeavour. I hope this explanations finds you in good health and I am waiting for the¬†support in full sense.

Even if the above explanation is not completely true, we should rely on and respect the PM of our country who is elected through clear democratic majority.

Further, the fact that when someone is holding¬†the new Rs. 2000 Rupee Note , he¬†is phychologicaly getting a sense of freshness that the country is in the growth phase. Messages are being circulated not to write anything on New Notes. Imagine if the Govternment would have never issued¬†new higher denominations notes with inflation and growth we would still be dealing with Annas and Pavlis!!

Sir, the above example also gives you an explanation as to why the withdrawal limit is kept so low because the above modus operandi can still be done with Rs. 500 note however, the incentive would be less because Mr. X cannot withdraw more than Rs. 10000/- in a day and even if he withdraws Rs. 10,000/-, there is every¬†possibility that Banks shall give Mr. X, ¬†2000 Rupee note. So Mr. X cannot follow the above modus operandi.

And believe me Sir, each and every condition in the Notification is seen to take care of the problems likely to be faced by Citizens and at the same time making sure that such Sophisticated theories are not resorted to by Black money hoarders, but questioning everything in the name of Freedom of Expression may create Panic situations or bring out Loopholes and hamper the success of reforms.

Point 2

Sir, you have again criticised and stated in the Video that printing Rs. 2000 rupee note will help to increase Corruption because Stacking those Rs. 2000 Rupee Notes would require lesser Space as compared to Stacking Rs. 1000 Notes.

In this regard, I would like to ask that Sir, have you come across any case where the ‚ÄúBabus‚Äù have not taken any bribe and done work honestly because they had a small Bag which could not be fitted with Rs 1000 Notes ?!

Or have you come across any Businessman who has declared unaccounted money solely because there was no space to keep those Rs. 1000 Notes !!

Point 3

As stated in the Video by you, it is true that inspite of PM efforts, there shall be dubious commission agents and unaccounted Investment in gold through jewellers, but as far as I remember when the jewellers were on strike for 45 days when¬†our PM levied excise duty on gold in month of April 2016, it was you who supported their strike. It shows that whenever some changes are suggested to regulate a particular Market, AAP¬†opposes them and then now you nag that the Gold market is unregulated.

Infact I believe that the PM had a full blue print for the development of our country right from Day 1 of his being elected¬†if I recall my last 3 years as a Professional.

Firstly they asked for all the bank account number in your Return of Income

Then they linked your PAN with Aadhar

They linked all the subsidies, pension and other benefits directly to your bank account through Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.

Then they gave opportunity to all the common men to open an account with bank through Jan Dhan Yojna

They entered into revised treaty with most of the countries in which unaccounted money goes through HAWALA e.g. Mauritius and thus the route of Black Money coming from Mauritius which everyone knew¬†is stopped.

They passed few strict laws to overcome the evil of black money such as Benami Transaction Act and Foreign Black Money Act

They levied Excise duty on Gold.

They also made TCS compulsory for Cash transactions above 2 lakhs.

They withdrew lakhs of pending income tax and service tax litigations where Common men had won at Appeal level and Department had gone further.

They also entered into information exchange agreement with such countries.

Then they gave last opportunity to all black money hoarders¬†through Income Declaration Scheme, 2016

Now they have a Scheme for Dispute Resolution Panel again to reduce Litigation till December 2016.

Now the masterstroke, that they have banned Rs. 500 & ¬†Rs. 1000 denominations.

Not only the destination of this whole process is commendable but even the journey or the chronology of these events is interesting which explains the ultimate destination and who knows , may be the journey is still not over and the ultimate destination may still be the Swiss Account holders!!

Point 4

Further, you have¬†stated in your Video that penalty would be levied at the rate of 200%. The said statement has created a panic and people have stated discounting their own hard earned cash.

Being in Income tax Department in the past , you ought to know that as per the present Income Tax Act,1961 penalty is never levied on Cash deposits but on ‚Äúconcealed income‚Äù. Hence when the common men is depositing Cash in hand which is duly accounted or out of his past savings and even out of unaccounted current years income whose return is yet to be filed, there shall not be any penalty if there is no mismatch between returned income¬†and assessed income. Even the Government Officials in their statement used the words ‚Äúunderreporting‚Äù or ‚Äúmismatch‚Äù. To understand the definition of¬†¬†‚Äúunderreporting‚Äù, Sir please refer Section 270A of the Income Tax Act or go through the following article:

Instead you could¬†have encouraged the citizens to pay appropriate Tax.

Point 5

Nowhere in the Video have you stated anything relating to Fake currency or Counterfeit Notes because you know that the issue of Existing Fake Currency is solved foolproof.

Which situation would be better ?

Scenario A:

A Labourer standing in queue to exchange Notes from bank for a Short term.

Scenario B :

A¬†Labourer working hard whole day to get a Fake Note at the end of the day?!

The issue of Terrorrist Funding is also¬†tackled but you chose to remain silent on the same.

You have stated that Modiji should have infused Rs 100 Note from before and it would have been you only to have said in this video that ‚ÄúArre ATM se do din pehle se hi Sirf Rs. 100 ki Note bahar aa rahi thi¬†toh sab ko pata tha , yek koi Secret nahi tha‚Äù

Conclusion

Now Sir, ¬†if I am to believe that you really don‚Äôt understand these simple concepts even after consulting with Experts for 2 days as already described by you, I am deeply saddened because the common men believe that you are an IITian and have spent considerable time in Income Tax Department also.

Contrary to the same, If I am to believe that you already know the benefits of¬†demonetization which I first learnt in Standard 8 when subject of economics was introduced to me and the concept of Peak Theory which is described by me above and which I learnt with my very limited experience while pursuing my profession of Chartered Accountancy , then I am more saddened and feel AAP Party as more dangerous because I believe that above any religion, politics or reservations in any caste or creed,¬†it will always be education which shall uplift the common men¬†and¬†it is the common men who have elevated you to a position where you are looked by millions as their Idol and it is your¬†duty to educate them and spread knowledge and not keep them in ignorance to preserve your¬†vote bank.

I am grateful to all my Teachers who have selflessly shared their knowledge and some fellow members of¬†CA fraternity who are playing an active role in creating awareness and educating Commonmen about the positive consequences of Demonetization true to the Jewel¬†crowned to the profession as ‚ÄúPartner in Nation Building‚Äù and I would therefore like to¬† advise the citizens not to sell the notes at discounted prices or deposit the cash into bank accounts of other benami persons in fear of penalty. Further, do not claim any bogus expenses or bogus loss to gain more trouble. Do not manipulate accounts by creating bogus cash on hand. Be sporty and pay tax honestly¬†to buy peace of building capital.

Jai Hind.

Regards,

Chartered Accountant

PS : Sir, Please share the same explanation to Rahul Gandhiji too as lately you both¬†share the same thoughts and statements and have same queries.

11/13/16, 10:53 AM - ANUPAM: Common sense and anecdotal evidence suggests that politicians are inclined to pamper their assured vote banks. Mamata Banerjee, for example, won‚Äôt stand up for gender justice on the triple talaq issue because she is far too dependant on the support of conservative Muslim organisations; and the Congress will drag its feet on fast-tracking the citizenship of Hindus and Sikhs from neighbouring countries because it wants that facility to be extended to Bangladeshi Muslims in Assam and West Bengal and even the Rohingyas from Myanmar. By that logic, the BJP would be loath to hit at the material interests of the trading community that has faithfully stood by it for long. It is hardly a state secret that the biggest source of black money generation is trade.
What we are witnessing is something quite fascinating ‚Äî the ability of an elected leader to use his mandate to look beyond sectional interests and address the national interest. Modi has actually taken a huge political risk by offending an influential section of the BJP‚Äôs traditional support for the sake of a higher national purpose, one that is calculated to make India more wholesome, if properly followed through.
In 2007, during the Gujarat assembly election, Modi had come under intense party pressure to waive the dues and the prosecution of more than one lakh farmers caught pilfering electricity through unauthorised connections. At that time Modi had privately told his colleagues that he would rather step down from leadership than agree to this short-sighted amnesty. His calculation was that the electorate will appreciate forthrightness and loftiness of purpose.
In Gujarat, the approach paid off. It is now on test in the whole of India.

11/14/16, 8:00 AM - ANUPAM: In over an hour long speech where Modi was overcome by emotion more than once, Modi said bureaucrats in Delhi have benami flats in Goa. He said his government has passed a law that has enabled it to crackdown on such properties.¬†


Parliament passed the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, in the monsoon session earlier this year. The amended law prescribes seven-year rigorous imprisonment for those dealing in black money in the real estate sector and also confiscation of benami properties.¬†

11/16/16, 7:57 PM - ANUPAM: New 2000 rs currency is not made with old currency material. Its similar to paper thickness. Within a week itself fake notes have entered the market.
The fake notes entered in market are color photocopy of 2000 curency. Since 2000 is new, many of them dont know the features of it. Here are 3 steps to easily identify. 
1. Security thread -The line which pass vertically through the currency. It appears green. On tilting the note it turns blue. 
2. Front side of note, left bottom you can see a rectangle. On tilting the note and concentrating you can see 2000 in it.
3. The white portion of the currency will have watermark of Gandhi which is visible on showing to light. 
On color photocopy these 3 features will not be seen. 

Kindly share this information and spread awareness.

11/17/16, 7:36 PM - Kashif: But ensure these guys should do d procedure  not the consultant ..as it always happen :-)
11/17/16, 7:36 PM - Kashif: Sorry wrong message on wrong group
11/17/16, 8:05 PM - ANUPAM: I have serious doubts about that. 
He is honest but
He is a very simplistic person. 
He took a very big gamble with very less preparation.

Baaki only time will tell.

If you remember Indira Gandhi made similar moves like nationalization etc. Now 30 year later we have to revert them.

Let's see.
I Dont think, this move was given much thought at all.

Some people definitely need to be fired.
11/17/16, 8:07 PM - ANUPAM: I have not heard a single good explanation of why 80%  ATM not working despite almost one week gone.All bullshit explanations.
11/17/16, 8:18 PM - Maaruti: Because 80 % of times 80 % of them never work , just that at time of crisis it became visibil
11/17/16, 9:05 PM - ANUPAM: Disagree.

Let's hope for the best.
I think it will turn out well.

But Modiji clearly doesn't have any idea of minimum government maximum governance,which he was uttering in 2014.

Anyways, no one should be ideology-tard, whatever works.
11/17/16, 9:56 PM - Kashif: People have lost all decency.

Yesterday, I burnt some garbage in the backyard.

This morning, everyone came asking, "How much...?!"üòúüò≥
11/17/16, 10:13 PM - Maaruti: ATMs are certainly overburdened, but in normal days it doesn't matter

11/17/16, 10:45 PM - ANUPAM: If you hate some one..he also controls you
11/17/16, 11:03 PM - Satish: 80 percent ATM not working due to recalibration issues..Check NCR corporation owner interview..
11/17/16, 11:04 PM - ANUPAM: And how much time does recalibration take
11/17/16, 11:04 PM - ANUPAM: Why it has not happened for 1 week now
11/17/16, 11:04 PM - Satish: Ideally few hrs..but if people are skilled enough...
11/17/16, 11:04 PM - Satish: #Skill India got missed seems
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - Satish: Also staff shortage is key competence of outsourced companies
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - ANUPAM: Not even a single ATM of Delhi was giving 2000 notes till Monday..
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - ANUPAM: Bullshiiety
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - ANUPAM: Bullshittery
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - ANUPAM: Only 100s
11/17/16, 11:06 PM - Satish: It suggests that minimum by month end all ATM will be re calibrated
11/17/16, 11:06 PM - Satish: I am not bullshittery
11/17/16, 11:06 PM - Satish: It is as per NCR corporation...biggest ATM provider owner interview
11/17/16, 11:06 PM - Kashif: Staff shortage because staff standing in line of bank

11/17/16, 11:08 PM - Satish: Likely lot of fake currency was being mixed
11/17/16, 11:09 PM - ANUPAM: You are wrong..there was no urgency to do this on 8th november
11/17/16, 11:09 PM - Satish: This is too much
11/17/16, 11:09 PM - Satish: Bhaiya kaa tumse pooch ke mahurat nikalata
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - Satish: Modiji said it was planned in last 6 months
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - ANUPAM: Look we were proud of surgical strike,because it was done cleanly and sent out message..
What would you have done if 5 soldiers would have died in operation..embarrassment no..
11/17/16, 11:11 PM - ANUPAM: Bakchodi , why is RBI governer not addressing media..
11/17/16, 11:11 PM - Satish: Comparing these 2 are not good
11/17/16, 11:11 PM - ANUPAM: His ass should be on line

11/17/16, 11:11 PM - ANUPAM: OK.accepted.
11/17/16, 11:11 PM - Satish: I disagree completely
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - Satish: SBI bengalan and RBI Governor can be on fire if things don't get fixed in 3 months
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - ANUPAM: Whose job is it to handle operations, assuming only 9-10 people knew
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - Satish: Jaitley and Urijit Patel
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - ANUPAM: And make no mistake it is Modi's popularity and credibility on line for their stupidity..
Very poor job.
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Satish: I can bet on this ...
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Satish: He is more popular than ever

11/17/16, 11:16 PM - Satish: He has planned this gamble
11/17/16, 11:17 PM - ANUPAM: He planned this gamble, but executed badly..

11/17/16, 11:54 PM - Abhishek: Ab sab kuch holi baad
11/17/16, 11:55 PM - ANUPAM: Call 100..and report him to police..
He can't keep more than three lakh at home as per law..
Otherwise force him to take cheque..
11/17/16, 11:56 PM - ANUPAM: If you are forced as a salaried employee to pay TDS..why the fuck should not he..
11/17/16, 11:58 PM - ANUPAM: Aise chutiyon ko hi to report karna hai Bhai..

11/18/16, 12:31 AM - Kashif: Besides , amateur surgeons have blood arranged as they do not know how much blood will they loose. I predict my blood loss before surgery very accurately. Sounds boastful but it's true

11/18/16, 12:56 AM - Kashif: But yes one thing I noticed the difference during internship in india and USA was the difference in blood transfusion rates and the need to prepare for blood transfusion. It was much less in USA

11/18/16, 8:05 AM - ANUPAM: During my travels in auto and talks , I realised one thing..poor people are happy because rich people ( people like us ) have been hurt..they say 'every one is hurt equally' so they are bearing with it..
Makes the point they hate rich as much as rich hate the poor,while coexisting and they are comfortable as long as we are hurt as well..
11/18/16, 8:09 AM - ANUPAM: Perhaps as much as kejriwal hates modi and vice versa..
I was expecting total chaos as ATM are still not working..
But hatred and suffering more to others mantra is making them bear this crisis out.

11/18/16, 10:15 AM - ANUPAM: It is tempting to imagine what would have happened if the Congress government had taken the same step. Or say, if the Aam Aadmi Party, if it had been at the Centre, had made the move?

It may have been disastrous because of how the parties are perceived by the people. Modi, for now, has the charm to get away with many reforms that other politicians and parties cannot. We must use this man to get some difficult things done.

11/19/16, 4:26 PM - ANUPAM: By agreeing to examine the validity of the Bodhgaya Temple Act, 1949, to nullify Hindu control over the famed vihara, the Supreme Court has inadvertently exposed The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, to scrutiny and opened the door for Hindu claims to historical temples they have demanded for centuries.
The Government headed by Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao passed the 1991 Act to prohibit any change in the character of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, and thus freeze disputes over religious sites seized during the medieval ages whose restitution was being demanded by the Hindu community. The Babri Masjid was excluded from the Act‚Äôs purview as it was sub-judice.

become someone like Ramdev Baba 
or 
spiritual Baba having annual income over Crores

OR

Send him to JNU to become * KANHAIYA*

 OR

leave him for getting result of ......
just 9th fail 
and 
become deputy CM like Tejaswi Yadav

OR

Go sell alcohol & take a loan like Malya and fly to London

Very very

11/22/16, 6:05 PM - ANUPAM: The novel opens in London in AF 632 (AD 2540 in the
Gregorian calendar ). The society described above is illuminated by the activities of two of the novel's central characters, Lenina Crowne and Bernard Marx, and the other characters with whom they come into contact. Lenina, a hatchery worker, is socially accepted and contented, but Bernard, a psychologist in the Directorate of Hatcheries and Conditioning, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average of his Alpha caste‚Äîa quality shared by the lower castes, which gives him an inferiority complex. His intelligence and his work with hypnopaedia allow him to understand, and disapprove of, the methods by which society is sustained. Courting disaster, he is vocal and arrogant about his differences. Bernard is mocked by other Alphas because of his stature, as well as for his individualistic tendencies, and is threatened with exile to Iceland because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering. The friendship is based on their feelings of being misfits (in the context of the World State), but unlike Bernard, Watson's sense of alienation stems from being exceptionally gifted, intelligent, handsome, and physically strong. Helmholtz is drawn to Bernard as a confidant.

11/24/16, 2:09 PM - Maaruti: Uske liye saalo Bhar planning hoti hai
11/24/16, 2:10 PM - Maaruti: No One
11/24/16, 2:10 PM - Maaruti: India as we all know is an organized chaos
11/24/16, 2:17 PM - ANUPAM: Then by the same logic..Even manmohan was not responsible for all scams under hi watch

11/24/16, 2:20 PM - Maaruti: Yes
11/24/16, 2:20 PM - Maaruti: That's why he is sitting MP of RS
11/24/16, 2:21 PM - Maaruti: Otherwise he should have been in Jail
11/24/16, 2:32 PM - ANUPAM: Actually he was coal minister when scams occurred.. got away because his parrot Ranjit Sinha didn't push enough..
Neither did Modi.
11/24/16, 2:33 PM - ANUPAM: Many auctions happened under his watch and he passed the blame to bureaucracy.. Instead of taking responsibility..
11/24/16, 2:34 PM - ANUPAM: So, bureaucracy stopped taking decisions/signing ..
It was also legacy of manmohan years.
11/24/16, 2:35 PM - Maaruti: Modi is like that Doctor who believes ki aaj tak jo Bhi kiya Jisne kiya , Sab Galat . Let's replan the management

Very very good speech.
11/24/16, 7:01 PM - ANUPAM: Makes following points.

1. India has been saved by families and NRI remittances ( because of family attachment- happens nowhere in world )

2. India has been in jobless growth from 2004-14(14 million jobs)..continues to be jobless now..
Between 1991-2004( 60 million jobs )

3. Indian economy is feminine ( high savings ) - saved us from recession

4. In presence of agreements, only way to bring external black money is by bribing foreign bank officials, as happened in HSBC case.

5. Anti dumping duty and tax give aays for chinese imports must be slowly removed and labour,land laws reformed to increase manufacturing.

6. India and China were 60% of GDP in 1750..
We can spring back..
We are much better than this.

Competition has increased in domestic market as companies fight for a shrinking order book pie. It also incurred losses due to inability to pass on cost escalation and other issues. In the first half of FY17, its revenue increased 8.6% to Rs 46,885 crore. Profits rose to Rs 2,044 crore from Rs 1,197 crore a year ag

We will say it again: By 2025, barely half the public sector banks will survive. Demonetisation has brought the day of reckoning closer.

11/24/16, 11:48 PM - ANUPAM: If Modi had said after victory that Muslims ran away after seeing virat hindoos coming to vote..

Or Trump had said Latinos and blacks and Muslims ran away on seeing his Juggernaut..

This guy Laloo actually said this. On national TV. I couldn't believe this when I heard this.
11/24/16, 11:50 PM - ANUPAM: That upper caste ran away, became frustrated on seeing lower caste coming to vote and ran away.

This he said as reason for victory.

Amazing asshole.
Never forget.
Never forgive.
11/24/16, 11:51 PM - ANUPAM: Plus this casteist asshole is a convicted politician, he is personally responsible for a decade of darkness and mass migration from Bihar , which affected poor people the most..

11/24/16, 11:54 PM - ANUPAM: While Bihar was poor before also, Laloo led to exodus of migration.
11/24/16, 11:55 PM - Satish: Exodus of landless was as good as Punjab is moving to Canada
11/24/16, 11:55 PM - ANUPAM: Because he had no interest in running state,ensuring law and order and employment.
11/24/16, 11:55 PM - Satish: Landless were abused by feudal castes and trader class
11/24/16, 11:55 PM - ANUPAM: Amazing one is choice,other is forced

11/26/16, 1:23 PM - vishalsatish: Fwd as rcvd from a HoxanüëáüèøAccording to Maj General Gagandeep Bakshi, Pakistan had 5 presses ready to print 15000 trillion of Indian Currency notes. When this intel was received to Prime Minister from secret agencies it was now or never situation for him. The pakistan could have created an economic pearl harbour siuation. And within few months we would have seen an extreme upsurge in terror activity in J and K and rest of India. 
Prime Minister went ahead and did it. Only select few knew about it. Now that it has been publicly accepted by Raga as well. 
It was never easy for the man called Narendra Modi. He inconvenienced his own vote bank.
He targeted his own people. Only to save a lot of innocents and averted temporarily a war like situation. Black money. Terrorism. Naksalites. maowadis. Strengthening the tier 3 Indian Banks who wouldn't have survived another global recession considering the mysterious Trump policy towards India. If America walls itself away from the rest of the world banks in tier 1 banks like of China could have survived but Indian Banks couldn't. One arrow many birds. 
He might even lose 2019. But I guess he won't regret it. He has already set his priorities straight. And that is India and Indians. 

I don't know about you. 

But I think our country is in right hands.
11/26/16, 1:24 PM - Satish: I felt the same...something more pressing was there than general economic interest

Next he will attack benami properties with vengeance.

It is cool and helpful like email .

Advantages :
1) your social capital will increase. You will be considered cool.

2) you will directly bring your poor classes in system very easily.

3) very easy to do transactions. I have taught it to all my colleagues and relatives.

4) more money in banking system means growth. Poor are protected against theft.

5) black money holders will be forced to deal in cheque and online once they reach critical mass.

6) you will reduce queues in this critical cash crunch.

Best of luck truly a patriotic/national thing to do.

Have you seen me ever trying to promote something as am doing for UPI..

We are @edge of something very important

11/26/16, 6:33 PM - Satish: Can't agree more
11/26/16, 6:39 PM - Satish: I can do more..but got lazy these days..m
11/26/16, 6:39 PM - Satish: Arvind must do more
11/26/16, 6:52 PM - ANUPAM: I Dont trust leaders/parties.
I trust solutions.
I truly believe a right solution if pushed by good political will can transform society.

Like green revolution did for agriculture.
Like opening up of economy did for economy
Like Rajeev Gandhi personally pushing computers helped India in becoming a giant in IT services.

Like mobile revolution did for communication

Like Aadhaar did for every poor getting an ID card in five years.

Yes demonetisation could have been done better.
Yes Modi as political leader had political motives.

But now it can't be undone.

But I truly believe it is moment to help bring banking to masses,it will help in reducing black money .This change has been forced and painful but also has potential to be revolutionary.

People like us are privileged. We can easily tide over.
But we can help others tide over this change by introducing them to banking system.

Never before in this country has been such awareness/discussion about black money/banking.

In this crisis is an opportunity.

Tum badlo.Logon ko badlo . Desh badlega

Asli superman woh hai Jo doosron ke liye, Bina powers ke bhi ladta hai..

Thankfully by working in a government set up as doctor even in frustrating conditions, I regularly get to help and touch lives of poorest of poor..

May be as an IAS , I could have brought change..but may be too cynical as well..and might have become a pawn..
11/26/16, 9:53 PM - Satish: Mujhe banwa deta
11/26/16, 9:54 PM - Satish: Doctori tho bas ki thii nahi

11/26/16, 11:17 PM - Maaruti: Find some other place to work
11/26/16, 11:18 PM - ANUPAM: Government makes policy.
If businessman violates policy book him.
11/26/16, 11:18 PM - Satish: You remember 10 year back doctors in India paid 20 k
11/26/16, 11:18 PM - Satish: Grossly underpaid
11/26/16, 11:18 PM - Satish: They stopped working?
11/26/16, 11:18 PM - Maaruti: Was that the case !!
11/26/16, 11:18 PM - Maaruti: When Bihar Govt put an ad for 20K how many applied
11/26/16, 11:19 PM - Satish: This utopian philosophy is similar to utopia Karl Marx thought was correct
11/26/16, 11:19 PM - ANUPAM: Sometimes if government makes wrong policy..every one can be a criminal
11/26/16, 11:19 PM - Maaruti: And yes I agree if someone wants to work for Rs 1 it's his choice
11/26/16, 11:19 PM - Satish: Trump

11/26/16, 11:20 PM - Satish: First thing first
11/26/16, 11:20 PM - ANUPAM: Listen satish, 
Govt makes policy..
Minimum wage is 300 per day..

If workers get less than that..they can leave no
11/26/16, 11:21 PM - Satish: Pom aisa nahi hota
11/26/16, 11:21 PM - Satish: You know that
11/26/16, 11:21 PM - Satish: What was software engineer salary in 2002?
11/26/16, 11:21 PM - Satish: In India entry level??
11/26/16, 11:21 PM - ANUPAM: So,
You are saying lack of jobs in society..
Because they Dont have choice
11/26/16, 11:22 PM - Satish: What is in 2016 entry level??
11/26/16, 11:22 PM - ANUPAM: In that case what is capitalists fault ?
11/26/16, 11:22 PM - Satish: No body is fault
11/26/16, 11:22 PM - ANUPAM: He shows wage of 300/day..and underpays 200/day
11/26/16, 11:23 PM - Satish: Yes
11/26/16, 11:23 PM - Satish: IT companies do same
11/26/16, 11:23 PM - Satish: All the tkme

But then they break law
11/26/16, 11:23 PM - Satish: Satyam overdid it
11/26/16, 11:23 PM - Maaruti: Arre Sir , agar aaj main Ek company kholu with a Capital of say 1 Lakh, you can't expect me to pay 10K as monthly salary , in due course if I succeed I might keep a Guard on that salary
11/26/16, 11:23 PM - ANUPAM: They run risk of getting booked/blackmailed/closure
11/26/16, 11:24 PM - Satish: I agree..
11/26/16, 11:24 PM - Satish: My point is we should not think one way of thinking is correct
11/26/16, 11:24 PM - Satish: And Robin Hood is bastard
11/26/16, 11:25 PM - Satish: I don't like necessarily like Robin Hood as well
11/26/16, 11:25 PM - Maaruti: Anyone who Leeches off after a certain age is a bastard
11/26/16, 11:25 PM - ANUPAM: Thus it is government's job to make policy close to ground reality..

In Delhi they raised every one's minimum wage to 500..you can only laugh.
11/26/16, 11:25 PM - Maaruti: I have seen many sons do it
11/26/16, 11:26 PM - Maaruti: Yes I can't call a 5 year old child as a leech
11/26/16, 11:26 PM - Satish: Then you have to abuse most of Rich  in India
11/26/16, 11:26 PM - ANUPAM: Plus politicians( or every one in India ) expect everyone one to be honest except themselves..
11/26/16, 11:26 PM - Satish: Absolute truth!!!
11/26/16, 11:26 PM - Satish: Crab mentality...the reason of happiness is others pain
11/26/16, 11:27 PM - ANUPAM: But 20-30% people are very honest in system..
11/26/16, 11:27 PM - Maaruti: For me I don't hold myself in giving back , if someone abuses me I won't keep quite
11/26/16, 11:27 PM - ANUPAM: As well..
11/26/16, 11:27 PM - Maaruti: Usko Uska hisaab wahi milega Aur Poora milega
11/26/16, 11:27 PM - Satish: Personally for me pure Capitalism works best...I don't know though what best for society
11/26/16, 11:28 PM - ANUPAM: Satish did you not see in coal India , our fathers working very hard, honestly even at low salaries.
11/26/16, 11:28 PM - ANUPAM: Old government village school teachers.
11/26/16, 11:28 PM - Satish: It's scam...
11/26/16, 11:29 PM - ANUPAM: 20-40% people will be honest and law abiding.
11/26/16, 11:29 PM - Satish: Yes..but did they left job at low salary...leaving jobs is not option
11/26/16, 11:29 PM - Satish: I will think 70 percent
11/26/16, 11:29 PM - Maaruti: Sir aate me Namak Bhar beimaani Sab Karte hain

11/26/16, 11:30 PM - ANUPAM: Many people in India, say income tax should be abolished as it makes most citizens criminals..üòã
11/26/16, 11:30 PM - Maaruti: But then I know I am risking a fine for it
11/26/16, 11:30 PM - Satish: Nahi re...Sab Aata maida mix hai bas chakki alag alag
11/26/16, 11:30 PM - Maaruti: Chaliye wahi
11/26/16, 11:31 PM - Maaruti: Maida me Mom Bhar beimaani
11/26/16, 11:31 PM - ANUPAM: Have transaction tax..

But even if you disagree you have to obey law, fight within system or leave it
11/26/16, 11:31 PM - Maaruti: Aise For me whole Concept of Income Tax is a sham
11/26/16, 11:31 PM - Satish: Yes best is transaction tax...Atm withdrawal 1 percent or payment by card 1 percent
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - Maaruti: Saala pahle hi kaat lo paisa
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - Satish: Personal income tax
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - Maaruti: Uske baad Salary
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - Satish: Business tax important for country to stand
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - ANUPAM: TDS bhi to tax hai
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - Maaruti: Wo bhi
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - ANUPAM: Yes correct term
11/26/16, 11:32 PM - Maaruti: It's a huge pain
11/26/16, 11:33 PM - ANUPAM: But I guess abolition of income tax very impractical that is why hasn't be done anywhere..

People can bypass transaction tax by not showing it all despite GST
11/26/16, 11:34 PM - Maaruti: Aise Barter system accha tha
11/26/16, 11:34 PM - Maaruti: Hahahaha üòàüòàüòà
11/26/16, 11:34 PM - Maaruti: Ye Currency jhand hai
11/26/16, 11:35 PM - ANUPAM: South Korea has banned booking air tickets, luxury hotels by cash..and it is a highly capitalist country
11/26/16, 11:35 PM - ANUPAM: In US/UK if you deposit more than 10 k dollars again and again..your property would be forfeitef
11/26/16, 11:35 PM - ANUPAM: Forfeited
11/26/16, 11:36 PM - Satish: I think cash should be only for 10 k or below item
11/26/16, 11:36 PM - ANUPAM: Both of them..
The most capitalist country in world
11/26/16, 11:36 PM - Maaruti: I think there should be no cash
11/26/16, 11:36 PM - Maaruti: Only PDS
11/26/16, 11:36 PM - Maaruti: Khaana Dena chahiye Sab ko

Cash is fast way of transaction.. Big govt can't trace you
11/26/16, 11:37 PM - Maaruti: Moroccan
11/26/16, 11:37 PM - Maaruti: Slave Trade was the best
11/26/16, 11:37 PM - ANUPAM: Sometimes you Dont want govt to trace you
11/26/16, 11:37 PM - Maaruti: Gulam rakho
11/26/16, 11:38 PM - ANUPAM: Eg. 
If you visit porn site ,
11/26/16, 11:38 PM - ANUPAM: Pay for spa..üòã
11/26/16, 11:38 PM - ANUPAM: If everything documented ..you can be blackmailed..

11/27/16, 12:18 AM - Maaruti: <Media omitted>
11/27/16, 8:22 AM - Satish: My #2 #paisa on media reporting..#Demonetisation 

#25 crore Jan Dhan Account got #21000 Crore..so on an average #840 Rs  per account and it seems massive corruption done in Jan Dhan Account...Why there is no disclosure in top 10 cash deposit till date?? Do we think poor should have zero cash??? 

I strongly believe Jan Dhan may be used as escape route by few...but #21000 crore in #850,000 crore is #2.5 percent and gets #95 percent attention vs #97.5 deposit for which no reporting coming up....

Government  and media must not loose focus on Builders, Jewellers and Buereaucrats which will be holding and doing various other channels for more than 80 percent of it...

11/27/16, 8:43 AM - ANUPAM: It is 70000 crore now..

The Jan dhan accounts won't be getting notices, they Dont even require PAN Card..

You would see multiple notices to top ten cash deposits..( that is how headlines will be managed )

Eg. Whenever govt is in some crisis, it will send income tax notice to a Seth/neta.

11/27/16, 5:55 PM - Maaruti: Infants don't die there

11/27/16, 5:55 PM - Maaruti: They are not allowed to born
11/27/16, 5:56 PM - Maaruti: Like in China when there was census which showed wide gap between 1 year and 10 year old population.

11/27/16, 7:15 PM - ANUPAM: And they didn't have any other option, couldn't even escape from the country
11/27/16, 7:16 PM - Satish: India has same situation I think till 2004...atleast in many states
11/27/16, 7:16 PM - ANUPAM: In Ukraine,Cuba cardiologists have same salary as teachers..at least they can run away from ukraine

11/27/16, 7:18 PM - Satish: I give devil's it's due
11/27/16, 7:18 PM - Kashif: Guys we are discussing things without context here. Satish is right in saying that you cannot judge Castro by talking to Cuban exiles.
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - Pankaj Jha: Abdulla ko kya hua
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - Satish: Whether Putin Modi Castro or anyone
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - Pankaj Jha: Bauraya hua hai
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - Kashif: Anupam is right in saying that Castro record was not great in a lot of respect
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - ANUPAM: Every person must have right to exit the system.
That is all I am asking for.
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - ANUPAM: Castro locked them up.
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - Kashif: But the point is this: one has to take a longitudinal view of castros life to gauge the impact he had on world history
11/27/16, 7:19 PM - ANUPAM: Amazing!
11/27/16, 7:20 PM - Satish: Also I believe alll exiles are traitors and  gaddars..to government...you can't judge based on their arguments
11/27/16, 7:20 PM - Kashif: Correct
11/27/16, 7:20 PM - Satish: Yes I agree
11/27/16, 7:20 PM - Pankaj Jha: <Media omitted>
11/27/16, 7:20 PM - Satish: But that doesn't take away all good here brings or works on..
11/27/16, 7:21 PM - ANUPAM: Like Hindus in Pakistan, Muslims in 2002 riots..amazing sensitivity !
11/27/16, 7:21 PM - Kashif: Castro's biggest contribution to south and Central America is this: he showed that the imperial capitalist of USA can be stopped and challenged
11/27/16, 7:21 PM - Satish: Yes I feel so..
11/27/16, 7:21 PM - Satish: I will not take Muslim Opinion on Gujarat Govt on everything
11/27/16, 7:22 PM - ANUPAM: Every person has right to escape a repressive system.
Who the fuck you are to tell you can't go.
11/27/16, 7:22 PM - Satish: I will be sensitive to what they say what happened to them
11/27/16, 7:22 PM - Satish: But not if they say Modi is bad on everything because he was allegedly involved in riots
11/27/16, 7:23 PM - ANUPAM: Modi didn't stop Muslims from running away from Gujarat in 2002.(which they did rightly at that time )
11/27/16, 7:23 PM - Satish: I am not saying that read above...I am saying I will not take their opinion  as final word on system
11/27/16, 7:23 PM - Satish: Modi is much better than Castro..why compare
11/27/16, 7:24 PM - ANUPAM: You are not getting a simple point..

Discrimination is one thing,locking them up is other..

Hitler,Castro,Mao ,Stalin all did that
11/27/16, 7:24 PM - Satish: I agree...
11/27/16, 7:24 PM - Satish: You are not getting my point
11/27/16, 7:24 PM - Satish: I willl not judge a nation on exiles bhagodas or runaways
11/27/16, 7:25 PM - ANUPAM: No I am getting your point..just that I abhor a person who restricts my right to runaway.
11/27/16, 7:25 PM - Satish: Neither Gujarat...Nor Bihar..Nor Cuba...Nor USA
11/27/16, 7:25 PM - Satish: I am also exile of Bihar
11/27/16, 7:26 PM - Satish: My opinion is irrelevant but opinion of Abhishek matters
11/27/16, 7:26 PM - Satish: And opinion of Kashif and Maruti is obsolete but Jhaji and Arvind Matters
11/27/16, 7:26 PM - Satish: Point is that simple
11/27/16, 7:26 PM - Satish: Hope you will understand
11/27/16, 7:27 PM - ANUPAM: Ya like you can't judge Hitler from runaway Jews.
11/27/16, 7:27 PM - Maaruti: I don't know But I spend almost 50 days in Bihar every year
11/27/16, 7:27 PM - ANUPAM: Look there are some crimes which can't be justified.

You can't put people in camps and make a country into jail.
11/27/16, 7:28 PM - ANUPAM: That is my only submission.
11/27/16, 7:28 PM - Maaruti: Donald trump is right
11/27/16, 7:28 PM - Maaruti: He didn't say a single word of praise for Castrated

11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Maaruti: Yes I agree
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Satish: Is Modi wrong he praised
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Maaruti: Jews were never prosecuted
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - ANUPAM: Keep on justifying.
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Maaruti: Yes he is wrong
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Maaruti: Modi is wrong and he is shifting
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Maaruti: Shitting
11/27/16, 7:29 PM - Satish: Samajho  Modi is preaching Neocommunism
11/27/16, 7:30 PM - Maaruti: Any commie bastard if he is praised then everyone is bullshitting
11/27/16, 7:30 PM - Satish: He wants SarveSarva and I want him to reach that level atleast next 7 years...
11/27/16, 7:31 PM - Satish: It's good for development of  India and Bharat
11/27/16, 7:37 PM - Satish: Trump is real hero and true world leader!!
11/27/16, 8:36 PM - ANUPAM: Castro: I will not die until America is destroyed .

11/27/16, 10:48 PM - ANUPAM: Dont talk anything
11/27/16, 10:50 PM - ANUPAM: I have never supported demonetisation whole heartedly..
Doesn't require a genius to infer its a risky move like Indira Gandhi's nationalization and garibi hatao.
11/27/16, 10:50 PM - Satish: Modiji moving to neocommunism
11/27/16, 10:51 PM - ANUPAM: That is very obvious from first day..that is why it is first time you have become fond of modi and I have become suspicious of him..no..üòã
11/27/16, 10:53 PM - Satish: I was fond of him always
11/27/16, 10:53 PM - Satish: üòúüòú
11/27/16, 10:54 PM - Satish: Now he fondling all...
11/27/16, 10:54 PM - ANUPAM: I have always said it is a risky idea (said because of my soft corner, can be very bad too) with very bad execution..

And risky because it will raise the stakes..

Next time he might go full commie retard if stopped..
11/27/16, 10:55 PM - Satish: He will
11/27/16, 10:55 PM - Satish: Traits he has shown in speeches which followed Demonetisation
11/27/16, 10:56 PM - Satish: Amir ki neend ki goli gareeb chain ki neend
11/27/16, 10:56 PM - ANUPAM: Benami,Tsunami sab chhod dega..

11/28/16, 9:45 PM - ANUPAM: If values n integrity is so fucked up..then why is such highly skilled health care cost so cheap compared to developed world.
11/28/16, 9:45 PM - ANUPAM: https://hbr.org/2013/11/delivering-world-class-health-care-affordably
11/28/16, 9:46 PM - Maaruti: The cost is so cheap because we are in abundance
11/28/16, 9:46 PM - ANUPAM: Two years ago, we kicked off a project to understand how some Indian hospitals are able to provide world-class health care at ultralow cost. We identified more than 40 hospitals with innovative strategies and selected nine of them for an in-depth study. Seven of the hospitals are for-profit and two, not-for-profit. Four focus on a single specialty, and the other five are multispecialty institutions. Seven of the exemplars operate as academic centers and integrate education and clinical research with health care delivery. We visited all the hospitals, gathered data, and conducted more than 100 interviews with the founding doctors, their leadership teams, physicians, staff, patients, and industry experts over several months.
The Indian hospitals we studied treat medical conditions that range from problems of the eye, heart, and kidney to maternity care, orthopedics, and cancer. Their charges for most procedures are as much as 95% lower than those at U.S. hospitals. That isn‚Äôt because the Indian providers offer low-quality services; five of the exemplars are accredited by either Joint Commission International (JCI), the international arm of the Joint Commission‚Äîan independent nonprofit that certifies the quality of more than 20,000 health care organizations in the U.S.‚Äîor its Indian equivalent, the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers, which uses standards similar to those of JCI. A sixth is seeking accreditation and a seventh has chosen not to do so for fear that the process could stifle experimentation and curtail innovation. The other two are not big enough to seek accreditation yet.
Some of these hospitals‚Äîfor instance, the Apollo Hospitals Group‚Äôs flagship in Hyderabad‚Äîhave recorded equivalent or better outcomes than the international standards for medical complications associated with knee, coronary, and prostate surgery as well as for infections related to the operating theater and catheters. NH‚Äôs 30-day postsurgery mortality rate for coronary artery bypass procedures at its Bangalore hospital is below the average rate recorded by a sample of 143 hospitals in Texas. Similarly, the five-year survival rate for breast cancer patients at HCG Oncology is comparable to U.S. benchmarks. Deccan‚Äôs five-year survival rate for peritoneal dialysis patients is the same as that for patients in the U.S. undergoing hemodialysis, the more expensive treatment commonly used there. Rates of complications associated with eye surgery at Aravind compare favorably with those of the best hospitals in the UK‚Äôs National Health Service.
How are some Indian hospitals able to provide such high-quality health care at ultralow prices? The obvious answer‚Äîthe differential in the cost of labor‚Äîdoes play a role: Cardiothoracic surgeons, nephrologists, ophthalmologists, and oncologists in India earn anywhere from 20% to 74% of what their American counterparts do. For instance, Aravind‚Äôs ophthalmologists earn $50,000 annually compared with the $253,000 average for U.S. ophthalmologists. NH‚Äôs cardiothoracic surgeons gross between $150,000 and $300,000, whereas the median income for their U.S. counterparts is $408,000. And the salaries of nurses, medical staff, and administrators in India are dramatically lower; some earn only 2% to 5% of what a U.S. hospital would pay.
But the labor cost differential is just a small part of the story. We calculated the price of an open-heart surgery at NH after adjusting the salaries of NH‚Äôs doctors and other staff to match U.S. levels. Even with the higher wages factored in, the cost was still only 4% to 18% of a comparable procedure in a U.S. hospital (see the exhibit ‚ÄúSalaries Are Only Part of the Equation‚Äù).
Moreover, other costs in India are higher than in the United States. Equipment, such as MRI machines, and supplies, such as stents, are more expensive, and so are the costs of capital and urban land. As a result, NH‚Äôs 21-point labor cost advantage relative to the Cleveland Clinic, for example, is mostly offset by a 17-point disadvantage in NH‚Äôs cost of supplies, pharmaceuticals, and other direct expenses.
To deliver on their dual commitments to high quality and ultralow cost, the Indian hospitals we looked at developed three powerful organizational advantages: a hub-and-spoke configuration of assets, an innovative way of determining who should do what, and a focus on cost-effectiveness rather than just cost cutting. Those process innovations allow the hospitals to lower their costs without compromising quality; in fact, the first two lower costs while simultaneously
improving quality. The innovations result not from a grand design but from constant experimentation, learning, adaptation‚Äîand necessity.
Let‚Äôs look at the process innovations in turn.
A Hub-and-Spoke Configuration of Assets
Most of the hospitals in our study started by establishing urban hubs in which they concentrate high-quality talent and sophisticated equipment. Spoke facilities are then arrayed around the hubs to reach underserved patients in far-flung towns and villages. Unlike suburban outposts of urban hospitals in the West, the spokes aren‚Äôt miniature hubs but rather gateways. In the U.S., most hospitals invest in duplicate equipment and offer a full range of services in their suburban facilities, but they‚Äôre unable to get much out of those investments in remote locations. Even when Western hospitals consolidate, their aim is to gain market power rather than to lower costs.
In India, the spoke facilities focus mainly on diagnosis, routine treatment, and follow-up care; they channel patients to the hubs for sophisticated procedures and surgery. HCG, for instance, has 17 spoke hospitals arrayed around four urban hubs in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore. Its specialists work in the hubs and have access to high-end equipment such as PET-CT scanners, cyclotrons, and linear accelerators, while at the spoke facilities, less specialized doctors provide care using less sophisticated equipment. The most highly trained oncologists, pathologists, and other physicians work in HCG‚Äôs center of excellence, a sort of super-hub, in Bangalore. The center houses equipment‚Äîsuch as an $8 million high-precision, robotic radiosurgery system called the CyberKnife‚Äîthat HCG can‚Äôt afford to duplicate even in its other urban hubs.
The hub-and-spoke approach is facilitated by the use of technology‚Äîsuch as telemedicine, which enables the remote delivery of health care over the phone‚Äîallowing doctors in the hubs to effectively and efficiently serve patients seeking care at the spokes. Physicians can, for instance, read medical images remotely and discuss the findings with their patients. Unless expensive equipment, complex tests, or consultations with super-specialists are required, patients receive care closer to their homes. That lowers the costs‚Äîsuch as lost wages during time away from work, transportation expenses, and room and board‚Äîthat often deter poor people from seeking health care even when it is free.
A hub-and-spoke architecture also helps create large volumes. By reducing the barriers to treatment, NH now carries out more open-heart surgeries and Aravind does more eye surgeries than any other hospitals in the world. In turn, this has increased physician productivity: At NH, each surgeon performs from 400 to 600 procedures a year, compared with 100 to 200 by U.S. surgeons. Similarly, Aravind doctors each perform from 1,000 to 1,400 eye surgeries a year, compared with an average of 400 by doctors in the United States.
As volume rises, doctors, equipment, and facilities are used more efficiently and costs fall. A U.S. hospital might use a PET-CT scanner to evaluate three to five patients a day; HCG conducts up to 20 scans a day. Several Indian exemplars run their MRI machines 24/7, sometimes charging lower prices at night when the machines would normally be idle, as an incentive to patients to get scans done at inconvenient times. Higher volumes also allow these hospitals to reap economies of scale in purchasing medicines, supplies, and medical equipment.
The hub-and-spoke configuration allows hospitals not only to lower costs but also to improve quality. It does that by:
Attracting and retaining doctors seeking to improve their skills rapidly.
The high volume and sheer variety of cases attract talent to these hospitals; doctors can build their capabilities faster in them. All seven of the academic hospitals we studied recruit many of their doctors from among their students. The caliber of the recruits, in turn, contributes to the high quality of outcomes at these hospitals.
Developing and continually updating treatment protocols that reduce errors.
Unlike many U.S. hospitals, the Indian health care providers have developed protocols for even relatively complex procedures, such as knee and hip replacements and cardiac and cancer surgery. For instance, at CARE Hospitals, angioplasty patients are assigned to one of three risk classes on the basis of objective criteria such as age, weight, medical history, and lifestyle, and a different protocol is followed for each, taking extra precautions for high-risk patients. (U.S. hospitals don‚Äôt always develop or follow such protocols, which is one reason Atul Gawande, an American surgeon and journalist, wrote
The Checklist Manifesto .) The results are impressive: Whereas data suggest that one in 200 angioplasty patients in the U.S. will require emergency surgery and half of those patients will die, only two out of 40,000 angioplasty patients at CARE Hospitals have required emergency surgery and just one has died on the operating table since the hospital‚Äôs inception in 1997.
Creating specialists in relatively rare subspecialties of medicine.
The large number of patients that come for treatment enables hub doctors to focus on specific types of medical problems. As volumes increase, relatively rare conditions are treated often enough that doctors become world-class experts in those areas. That‚Äôs how NH has become a global leader in pediatric open-heart surgery, attracting patients from across Asia and Africa. High volumes have allowed Apollo to become a leader in organ transplant surgeries and made L V Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) a top provider in corneal transplants.
Promoting innovation that suits local conditions.
Doctors in India pioneered the beating-heart method of surgery, by which they can operate without shutting patients‚Äô hearts down. This technique enables surgeons to perform the procedure without expensive heart-lung machines, which are rare in a developing economy. The method also leads to fewer complications, requires shorter hospital stays (which results in a lower incidence of hospital-related infections), and allows patients to recover faster. High patient volumes have allowed Indian doctors to master the technique over time.
Examples abound of innovations sparked by the need to overcome constraints in emerging markets. Aravind has perfected the manual small-incision cataract surgery technique. It requires less sophisticated equipment and less seasoned surgeons and uses cheaper lenses than the phacoemulsification technique favored by U.S. hospitals. CARE Hospitals and other Indian providers typically perform angioplasties by going in through the wrist (rather than the groin, which takes more time to heal), allowing them to discharge patients the same day. Deccan Hospital uses peritoneal dialysis, a home-based treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease that is substantially cheaper than hospital-based hemodialysis, the more common treatment in the United States. And LVPEI has developed technology that allows a single cornea to be sliced and used for more than one transplant patient.
Rethinking Who Does What
By shifting tasks, the best Indian hospitals match the skill levels of their people with the basic requirements of tasks. Assigning doctors to tasks that nurses can do, for instance, not only raises costs but may also reduce quality; doctors are often less proficient at routine tasks than are nurses.
Indian hospitals have taken task-shifting to a new level by creating fresh categories of low-cost health care workers at one end of the spectrum and highly focused specialists at the other. Unable to lure trained personnel to rural villages, for example, LVPEI has hired and trained high-school graduates as ‚Äúvision technicians‚Äù in its spoke facilities, where they take over some of the functions of optometrists. Similarly, Aravind has trained village girls to become ophthalmic paramedics; they constitute 64% of Aravind‚Äôs workforce and perform tasks such as admitting patients, maintaining medical records, and assisting doctors.
At the high-skills end of the spectrum, NH encourages general physicians to become specialists, and specialists to become super-specialists. It trains nurses to advance to the higher-skilled position of nurse intensivist, akin to a nurse practitioner in the United States. Similarly, HCG has developed a cadre of nurses to assist oncologists and intensivists, and LVPEI‚Äôs vision technicians have the option of enrolling at its optometry school to become optometrists.
The exemplar hospitals maximize their efficiency by increasing the number of staff supporting their most skilled surgeons and specialists, radically extending their reach. Each Aravind surgeon, for example, has help from six paramedics in the clinical domain and four assistants for administrative and support services. Paramedics go to a village, screen patients, transport them to the spoke hospital, check their vitals, get tests performed, prepare patients for surgery, deliver postsurgical care in the ward, transport them back to the village, and provide follow-up care. The surgeon performs only the actual procedure. To cut costs, U.S. hospitals often eliminate low-skill staff jobs, which forces doctors to spend more time on routine tasks‚Äîresulting in the wrong kind of task shifting.
Another way of increasing surgeons‚Äô productivity is to decrease the amount of time it takes to move one patient out of the operating theater and bring in the next one. That is the key factor limiting efficiency and a key driver of costs, according to a global study of performance benchmarks in knee-replacement surgeries. Eric Wadsworth, the coleader of Dartmouth‚Äôs health care delivery science program, concurs. ‚ÄúInstead of looking at when patients are wheeled into and out of surgery, hospitals should look at the interval between when one patient is wheeled out and the next is wheeled in.‚Äù
Aravind tackles the challenge in cataract surgery by setting up two surgical stations side by side, with the surgeon positioned between them, assisted by a swiveling microscope and two pairs of paramedics. For each patient, one nursing paramedic hands the doctor sterile instruments and the right implants, focuses the microscope, and bandages the patient. The other paramedic‚Äîcalled a running nurse‚Äîreplaces used surgical instruments with sterilized ones and moves the patient into and out of the operating theater. Switching smoothly from one patient to another, Aravind‚Äôs doctors briskly perform operations in 10- to 12-minute intervals, completing five or six in an hour rather than the one or two that a surgeon can handle in a conventional operating suite assisted by a single nurse.
An extreme form of task shifting is self-service, where patients and family members take over tasks traditionally performed by hospital staff. At the NH hospital in Mysore, for instance, family members provide non-ICU postoperative care. As with other kinds of task shifting, success depends in large part on proper training. Working with Stanford University, NH has developed a four-hour audio and video curriculum that explains how to care for patients during the three days following heart surgery. Allowing family members to provide those services reduces costs, allows for personalized care, and ensures continuity of care at home, reducing postsurgical complications.
Asserting Frugality
Maximizing the volume of procedures performed is obviously not the goal of any hospital, but many aspects of the current U.S. system‚Äîespecially approaches such as fee-for-service payment models‚Äîcreate incentives for health care providers to move in that direction. In the hospitals we studied in India, the goal is to maximize the number of patients treated rather than the number of procedures conducted. To achieve that goal, those hospitals must embrace a mind-set of old-fashioned frugality, applied in ways both innovative and remarkably mundane. Cost cutting is an ongoing priority, even among doctors.
Among the hospitals‚Äô most straightforward cost-cutting measures are efforts to prolong the working life of expensive technology through careful maintenance and repair. To that end, NH has contracted with a U.S. maintenance company, TriMedx, to help double the life of diagnostic equipment. Some hospitals routinely reuse medical devices sold as single-use products‚Äîsuch as $160 steel clamps employed during beating-heart surgeries, which CARE Hospitals and NH sterilize and reuse 50 to 80 times. ‚ÄúIf no hospital in the world throws away their needle holders, forceps, and scissors, which are drenched in blood after every operation, why throw out the clamps?‚Äù asks Devi Shetty, NH‚Äôs founder-chairman. In fact, JCI allows accredited hospitals to reuse devices as long as they adhere to its strict sterilization procedures.
Indian hospitals economize on decorating lobbies, wards, patient rooms, hallways, and offices. Senior managers often share small offices, freeing space for mission-critical areas such as operating theaters. Several hospitals lease rather than buy land and buildings; both are quite expensive in India. Some choose not to purchase expensive diagnostic equipment but rather strike pay-per-use deals with equipment providers, as NH has done for more than one of its hospitals. Suppliers such as GE, Philips, and Siemens are happy to offer such arrangements because the volume of patients is huge.
The hospitals we studied think carefully about matching the sophistication of equipment to the task. LifeSpring orders smaller and simpler beds for its maternity wards but does not skimp on the delivery tables for operating rooms in its 12 hospitals in Hyderabad. Vaatsalya has opted for lower-resolution, black-and-white ultrasounds and three-parameter patient monitors, where appropriate, instead of five-parameter monitors in its 18 hospitals in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
To reduce waste, Apollo Hospitals asked suppliers to shorten the length of sutures in each packet‚Äîand to lower the price accordingly‚Äîafter it found that its doctors were routinely discarding one-third of each suture after procedures. Some health care providers have gone further by coming up with less costly substitutes for supplies or equipment. CARE Hospitals, for instance, has developed stents priced from $240 to $360 apiece that perform as well as imports that cost 10 times as much. It has set up a subsidiary to manufacture the stents, along with catheters and other devices. Aravind has signed a technology-transfer agreement with the Florida-based IOL International and set up a company in southern India, Aurolab, to manufacture intraocular lenses. When the lenses debuted in the U.S., they sold for $200 each. By the mid-1990s, Aurolab was turning out lenses for $5 apiece, and the price had dropped to $2 a unit by 2013.
The focus on costs applies to physicians‚Äô wages as well. The exemplar hospitals pay doctors a fixed salary, offering no bonuses or other incentives for internal referrals for tests or procedures‚Äîan approach much discussed by health care thinkers in developed countries but usually not implemented because of fee-for-service incentives. The best Indian hospitals offer fixed prices for a package of common medical treatments rather than pricing for individual procedures or tests. The fixed-price model discourages doctors from ordering unnecessary procedures, while protocols ensure that essential procedures aren‚Äôt skipped.
The hospitals we studied infuse cost awareness across the organization in many ways. At NH, all doctors receive a daily text message with the previous day‚Äôs P&L data. The practice induces doctors to be prudent; they can see how their decisions about which medicines, supplies, or tests to use affect the cost of treating patients. It also motivates them to suggest ideas for cost savings and process improvements. NH‚Äôs doctors get comparative performance data for their own hospital and 21 others in the group, which encourages them to share best practices. In contrast, most U.S. hospitals lack an understanding of their costs: Few CFOs, let alone doctors, seem to know the real cost of delivering services.
Lessons for U.S. Hospitals
Just how transferable is the Indian model to the developed world? Barriers certainly exist, among them regulations, fee-for-service incentives, pharmaceutical lobbies, trade unions, medical malpractice lawsuits, and investments in extensive hospital infrastructure. However, the hurdles may be lower than many suppose. U.S. hospitals, for example, treat higher volumes of cardiac, kidney, and cancer patients than their Indian counterparts do, suggesting that opportunities exist to reap learning-curve benefits and economies of scale. Salary differences, large as they are, aren‚Äôt insurmountable since they constitute only a small part of the cost differential.
Innovation has flourished in the U.S. in the development of new medications, procedures, devices, and medical equipment‚Äîbut in the field of health care delivery, there has been too little progress. Health care is still viewed as a craft, especially by doctors who guard their right to make autonomous decisions and view each patient as unique.
Some of the practices we have described are being implemented by progressive U.S. hospitals. California-based CareMore, for instance, engages in task shifting, having created a category of health worker known as extensivists, who coordinate care for Medicare patients, producing better outcomes at a lower cost. Iora Health clinics in Las Vegas and Brooklyn employ former schoolteachers and athletic trainers to help patients make behavioral changes, freeing physicians to focus on diagnosis and treatment. Boston-based Steward Health Care uses a tele-ICU system to provide efficient intensive care across its 10 hospitals. The Vermont Department of Health is implementing a hub-and-spoke arrangement to treat people with opioid addiction.
In the coming decade, U.S. hospitals will be under even more pressure to lower costs, improve quality, and expand access‚Äîthe very things the Indian hospitals we studied have been tackling. Demand will surge as aging baby boomers are joined by the millions of patients who will be covered by the Affordable Care Act in 2014. U.S. hospitals should use the swelling demand to get more out of the investments they‚Äôve made‚Äîby reconfiguring assets, shifting tasks, promoting innovation, and cultivating frugality. Such moves don‚Äôt require changes in legislation; only a commitment to reverse the inexorable rise in costs.Indian hospitals, doctors, and administrators have traditionally looked to the West for advances in medical knowledge, but it‚Äôs time the West looked to India for innovations in health care delivery. Changes in the U.S. health care system will not come easily or quickly. However, the U.S. health care system could operate very differently if it were exposed to the kind of low-cost innovation that drives the best Indian hospitals.
A version of this article appeared in the November 2013 issue of Harvard Business Review.
Innovation at Indian hospitals results not from a grand design but from constant experimentation, adaptation‚Äîand
11/28/16, 9:47 PM - ANUPAM: The ultra-low-cost position of Indian hospitals may not seem surprising ‚Äî after all, wages in India are significantly lower than in the U.S . However, the health care available in Indian hospitals is cheaper even when you adjust for wages: For example, even if Indian heart hospitals paid their doctors and staff U.S.-level salaries, their costs of open-heart surgery would still be one-fifth of those in the U.S.
11/28/16, 9:48 PM - ANUPAM: When it comes to innovations in health care delivery, these Indian hospitals have surpassed the efforts of other top institutions around the world, as we discussed in our recent HBR article . Today, the U.S. spends $8,000 per capita on health care; if it adopted the practices of the Indian hospitals, the same results might be achievable for a whole lot less, saving the country hundreds of billions of dollars.
A key to this is that, faced with the constraints of extreme poverty and a severe shortage of resources, these Indian hospitals have had to operate more nimbly and creatively to serve the vast number of poor people in need of medical care in the subcontinent. And because Indians on average bear 60% to 70% of health care costs out of pocket, they must deliver value. Consequently, value-based competition is not a pipe dream but a reality in India.

11/28/16, 10:31 PM - Satish: But again remember Pom said don't judge based on 1 maid 1 driver or 1 doctor experience...
11/28/16, 10:31 PM - Maaruti: I didn't even know the consultant's name
11/28/16, 10:32 PM - Maaruti: So my point is , I am saying the role of institutions like AIIMS is not to treat your cough and cold or some random sickness
11/28/16, 10:32 PM - Maaruti: They are elite institute to format or formulate treatments which needs to be diligently followed all over the country
11/28/16, 10:33 PM - Maaruti: That's what they are paid for and that's what they should be doing
11/28/16, 10:33 PM - Pankaj Jha: Sir when I go to RML and AIIMS to meet those with some health ministry or MP reference and how the same doctors treat a commoner is quite bizarre
11/28/16, 10:35 PM - Pankaj Jha: And that is why I said a doctor is a human too an Indian too a member of this samaj too he is no different from a Vakil or Pattakarampalayam
11/28/16, 10:35 PM - Pankaj Jha: Patrakar
11/28/16, 10:36 PM - Pankaj Jha: Rog dekh k treatment karne wale Haisiyat dekh k treatment karte hain aur phir ethics aur Morals ka Gyan bhi dete hain
11/28/16, 10:37 PM - Maaruti: See Haisiyat will always be part of treatment
11/28/16, 10:37 PM - Maaruti: Medically as well
11/28/16, 10:37 PM - Pankaj Jha: Ha ha ha ha
11/28/16, 10:38 PM - Maaruti: That's why we have Doctors for President / Queen / PM
11/28/16, 10:38 PM - Pankaj Jha: Was expecting this from you that u will even try to prove this that this is the most rational thing to do
11/28/16, 10:39 PM - Pankaj Jha: Kyun Theory of equity yahan nahin
11/28/16, 10:39 PM - Pankaj Jha: Right to Equitable Treatment nahin
11/28/16, 10:39 PM - Maaruti: Did I say that I am defending theory of equality
11/28/16, 10:39 PM - Maaruti: I am defending Right of Doctor
11/28/16, 10:44 PM - Maaruti: As an individual he has right to choose anyone whom he wants to treat , as a professional he is expected to be as efficient as possible  and As a person he is duty bond to  let you know the best case scenario and worst possible outcome .
11/28/16, 11:32 PM - ANUPAM: Pankaj ,
Have you thought why people rightly complain of preferential treatment at AIIMS/RML and never complain about that in private hospitals..(even CGHS patients)
11/28/16, 11:33 PM - Maaruti: Haan Paisa , Kya Paisa , Na Paisa , Wah Paisa
11/28/16, 11:35 PM - Maaruti: When Shit hits the fan , some stand and some run for cover üòàüòàüòà
11/28/16, 11:35 PM - ANUPAM: Actually that VIP patient is not being seen preferentially,he is just being given standard of care which is routine in private hospitals..15 minutes of patient visit.
11/28/16, 11:36 PM - ANUPAM: While non VIP patients , in crowded OPD are given 2 minutes of time..because what to do..too many patients. Too few docs..
11/28/16, 11:37 PM - ANUPAM: Now in a developed country if that doctor disposed a patient in two mins. He would be dismissed from care.
11/28/16, 11:40 PM - Maaruti: Triage is a part of opd care
11/28/16, 11:40 PM - Maaruti: Kar Lein India me Sarkari sewa me triage
11/28/16, 11:41 PM - ANUPAM: Entire government hospitals survive on repression of post graduate residents.
Initially everyone is idealistic,n then everyone gives up on seeing the deluge .and triage becomes work culture
11/28/16, 11:43 PM - Maaruti: Pom sir Aap sirf Teaching Govt hospital ki baat kar Rahe hai
11/28/16, 11:43 PM - Maaruti: Baaki Non teaching me JR üòÇüòÇüòÇ
11/28/16, 11:44 PM - ANUPAM: Bhai he has given reference of teaching hospitals only.
11/28/16, 11:44 PM - ANUPAM: True..!
11/28/16, 11:47 PM - ANUPAM: He is right vaise, in name of equity,the politician should be seen for two minutes only.But what to do he owes that seat to that contacts.

But inspire of that you will never see a patient being removed from ventilator,so that politico can be put on it.
Or endoscopy of a bleeding hematemesis in shock postponed because a routine endoscopy of politico is to be done.
11/28/16, 11:48 PM - ANUPAM: The same docs when put in optimal conditions,with optimal staff and optimal workload perform exemplary work under low cost.
11/28/16, 11:49 PM - ANUPAM: Baaki waiting times for a hernia operation is 1 year in NHS and Canada as well.
11/28/16, 11:50 PM - Satish: So jao

11/29/16, 7:02 AM - Pankaj Jha: Anupam Bhai u again missed the point don't think about AIIMS and Apolo of India Saharsa aur Bettiah ka baat nahin kijiye. Ever wondered why Pappu Yadav is beating doctors and why are Doctors get beaten by Praja
11/29/16, 7:03 AM - Pankaj Jha: The point I am reiterating is restlessness to make money by doing things which amount to harassment of Patients
11/29/16, 7:04 AM - Maaruti: Doctors get beaten up because they are less in number and don't form a vote bank . They are too busy either in to their job , academics or their own apolitical life or politics .
11/29/16, 7:04 AM - Pankaj Jha: End of the Day AAp log service provider bhi hain Maalik log
11/29/16, 7:04 AM - Maaruti: No

11/29/16, 7:05 AM - Pankaj Jha: Health is a service like education
11/29/16, 7:05 AM - Pankaj Jha: You must be joking
11/29/16, 7:05 AM - Maaruti: Not to serve you what suits your palate
11/29/16, 7:05 AM - Maaruti: Not at all
11/29/16, 7:06 AM - Maaruti: Doctors job is not to serve you , it's his job that you get what's best for your illness or health
11/29/16, 7:07 AM - Pankaj Jha: Maruti bhai ab aap ek Rashtrabhakt ki tarah baat kar rahe Ho joh Sharia Banking ko support and implement karwane chahta hai Desh k liye
11/29/16, 7:08 AM - Maaruti: I will understand the preferential treatment someone gets , all our life we do it , all our life we get it . Nothing so unusual . A sick patient gets preference over a Green banded one
11/29/16, 7:08 AM - Pankaj Jha: And when you say that you are also saying what is good for me depends on how much money I have in my wallet
11/29/16, 7:08 AM - Pankaj Jha: Money determines the preference
11/29/16, 7:09 AM - Maaruti: Perhaps , if you can afford a service you will get it , if not then God bless you
11/29/16, 7:09 AM - Maaruti: Money might determine somethings not all
11/29/16, 7:10 AM - Maaruti: Money won't determine how you will respond to a mode of treatment
11/29/16, 7:10 AM - Pankaj Jha: Sir Daant nikalwane apolo Gaye the Air hostess jaise doctor thi aur poora comfort de rahi thi sarkari mein jaate to daant k illaaz karta
11/29/16, 7:10 AM - Maaruti: Money might Determine your treatment
11/29/16, 7:11 AM - Pankaj Jha: It is major major determinant
11/29/16, 7:11 AM - Maaruti: Give 5 cases per day to A doctor in sarkari
11/29/16, 7:11 AM - Maaruti: And speak well to them
11/29/16, 7:11 AM - Maaruti: Like we all know
11/29/16, 7:12 AM - Maaruti: When a patient goes to private , they will pay through their nose and be well behaved as well .
11/29/16, 7:12 AM - Pankaj Jha: Aap Saharsa Bhagalpur aur Bettiah Madhubani ka baat kijiye Na AIIMS aur Max ka Kyun baat karte hai

11/29/16, 7:14 AM - Pankaj Jha: Reach where Aiiims and max
11/29/16, 7:14 AM - Maaruti: Maruti won't go to Sabour because he doesn't want to get kidnapped .
11/29/16, 7:14 AM - Chaurasia New: Good morning
11/29/16, 7:14 AM - Pankaj Jha: Aap kya oath liye the Oman jaane ka
11/29/16, 7:14 AM - Chaurasia New: Sab ko good wishes

11/29/16, 7:18 AM - Maaruti: I support Sharia Banking for simple reason , because it will give you Interest free loan
11/29/16, 7:19 AM - Maaruti: No Interests on deposit , no interests On loan
11/29/16, 7:19 AM - Pankaj Jha: If that is so Then u can't speak for a Dactar who is working in Saharsa
11/29/16, 7:19 AM - Pankaj Jha: Bharat Mata ki Jai
11/29/16, 7:20 AM - Pankaj Jha: You don't have an option to oppose it
11/29/16, 7:20 AM - Maaruti: I have always an option to oppose it
11/29/16, 7:20 AM - Maaruti: When you will get car loan without interest I am sure you will oppose it
11/29/16, 7:21 AM - Maaruti: Or a house loan without interest I am sure no one will oppose it

11/29/16, 7:24 AM - Pankaj Jha: You are just implying What is good and a Norm in Middle East should be adopted in India just because now Modi views it so
11/29/16, 7:25 AM - Maaruti: I am of view if something is good it must be adopted
11/29/16, 7:25 AM - Maaruti: Simple

11/29/16, 7:42 AM - Pankaj Jha: Aapke Jaise log hain joh Raja aur Praja mein Vishwas aur Soch Rakhte hain
11/29/16, 7:43 AM - Satish: Kyunki Amiri bhi ek disease hai...Modiji is treating it radically
11/29/16, 7:43 AM - ANUPAM: There is no doubt that we are service providers.as is a lawyer,school.

There is no doubt that in remote areas some doctors practice unethical medicine.

There is no doubt MCI has failed in its duty to punish malpractices, as have many regulators in India.

But
a) it is very difficult/impossible for a patient to judge performance of a doctor. In fact a surgeon can't even judge performance of physician. So no one has right to peetna/pitana.


b)if private lawyers/teachers have right to reject clients ,docs should also have right.

c) you are asking private players to take job of a state.
Very tricky

It is government's job to open up a good medical college/district hospital in betiah..and enforce that those who are posted there do their duty properly

Not private practitioners.
11/29/16, 7:43 AM - Satish: Sir hamko Rani sab pasand hai
11/29/16, 7:43 AM - Pankaj Jha: Joh chahte hain Bhagalpur ka Aadmi AIIMS aaye aur dhakka khayenge ya Phir Apolo ko chadhawa chadhaye

11/29/16, 7:45 AM - Pankaj Jha: Aapke aur Maruti mein phasaad ho to jyada Justice usko joh ya to jyada tax diya ho aur jyada Vakil ko fees
11/29/16, 7:45 AM - Maaruti: Sir if PHC fails CHC will be over Burdened , If CHC fails then Secondary Care will suffer and Later Tertiary and Quart nary will do eventually
11/29/16, 7:45 AM - Satish: Anupam baby good morning ...Uthhh Gaya... duniya ko Gaali chalu karo..
11/29/16, 7:45 AM - Pankaj Jha: Let's Rank the Raja's
11/29/16, 7:45 AM - Maaruti: It's your choice if you want to treat AIIMS as PHC
11/29/16, 7:46 AM - ANUPAM: RTE is a joke.

CSR is a joke.

25% BPL ke liye private hospitals me bhi reserved hai.

While it is good for normal people to assume that private players will take up job of govt..only wishful thinking.
11/29/16, 7:46 AM - Satish: Maruti and I very chalak...Court tak nahi jayenge...deal seal...

11/29/16, 7:47 AM - ANUPAM: By the way on the slippery slope,when are you supporting 50% reservation for marginalised communities in E&Y.

See can easily become a slippery slope.
11/29/16, 7:48 AM - Satish: Yes Tax is nothing but Angrezon  ka lagaan
11/29/16, 7:48 AM - Pankaj Jha: Why should they not we believe they should also tax Maruti
11/29/16, 7:48 AM - ANUPAM: And 50% reservation in private jobs.

11/29/16, 7:50 AM - Maaruti: I don't even know what is my banking details
11/29/16, 7:50 AM - Maaruti: Money is not my concern
11/29/16, 7:50 AM - Maaruti: I have better things to do
11/29/16, 7:50 AM - Pankaj Jha: Reservation in EY only to Dalits and they should take over why only 50% when they need 100
11/29/16, 7:51 AM - Maaruti: But if you ask me to go to CA or some other Joker to file Taxes and all , I won't do it
11/29/16, 7:51 AM - Pankaj Jha: But you don't pay tax
11/29/16, 7:51 AM - Maaruti: Yes
11/29/16, 7:51 AM - Maaruti: I don't pay Tax

11/30/16, 6:32 PM - Kashif: <Media omitted>
11/30/16, 6:32 PM - Kashif: Why shouldn't it also be played every morning
Inside all Court rooms
Each Govt office
The Parliament
All Corporate HQs

Nationalism is a must for all, no? Including Judges, industrialists,  Ministers, Politicians, Bureaucrats, Government Employees...

Why not also make it compulsory for all weddings, parties/feasts and even restaurants - why make Indians feel patriotic only inside a cinema hall? Nationalism is a 24/7 sentiment, isn't it?

Here's a partial list of other spaces to play the #NationalAnthem :

1. Till Dec 31, every time cash arrives at an ATM. If people are standing upright nationalistically, there'd be no more mayhem & chaos in the long queues.

2. Before every TV soap opera and PrimeTime news bulletin - viewers must stand at attention inside their homes. All TVs must henceforth be manufactured with a built-in webcam, with the feed going directly to the local CBI office to enable swift prosecution of all offenders.

3. Before any dance/ music/ theatre performance in any auditorium

4. At all political party offices every morning - if all politicians get infected with nationalism, there'll be no more corruption, black money and demonetisation!

5. Inside maternity wards at every hospital - catch 'em young and turn them into pucca patriots.

6. At all stock exchanges & by extension, all share-trading & brokerage firm offices - no more insider/ Benami trading!

7. Inside every airplane, just after safety instruction demos

8. At all railway stations & bus terminals

9. Inside every disco & nightclub - at each DJ changeover

10. Inside factories - if nationalism infects each worker, no more strikes!
11/30/16, 6:35 PM - Satish: Agreed Kashif it should be everywhere where there is assembly
11/30/16, 6:36 PM - Satish: School Sales meeting college festival ...

11/30/16, 9:58 PM - Satish: Many many years ago, when I was in school, I heard the following story: 

Once Badshah Akbar' s army was engaged in a prolonged war. As a result his royal wealth ("shahi khazana") was nearly exhausted.
He asked Birbal, "How to replenish my wealth."
Birbal: You can get it from Dhanna Seth.(merchant).
Akbar was amazed as to how a trader/ merchant could have so much money. Still he went to Dhanna Seth. 
Dhanna Seth offered: Badshah Akbar, I have huge wealth, take as much as you want."
Akbar: Dhanna Seth, How did you accumulate so much wealth. Tell me without any fear of punishment.
Dhanna: I earned it by adultrating grains & spices.
Akbar got angry, he took all of Dhanna's wealth and ordered him that from then on he would collect the horse dung  in his royal stable. Dhanna agreed.
Years passed by. Again Akbar had to fight a long drawn battle. Again his royal wealth exhausted & again Birbal advised Akbar to go to Dhanna Seth for help.
Akbar wondered : Birbal, I had ordered him to work in royal stable to collect horse dung, How on earth he can have such a wealth."
Birbal: Badshah, you can ask him but only he can help you.
Akbar went to Dhanna. Dhanna gave Akbar huge wealth.
Akbar: Dhanna Seth, I had earlier taken all your wealth, How did you accumulate it again?
Dhanna: From the stable - incharge  & horse attendants. They used to underfeed the horses. I threatened them that I will complain to Badshah that they did not feed horses enough, hence the horse dung quantity was less. So they bribed me to keep silent.
Akbar got very angry again & ordered Dhanna to start counting the waves at sea & returned to his Palace with Dhanna's wealth.
As luck would have it, Akbar fought another war, royal wealth emptied out and once again Birbal advised Akbar to go to Dhanna  Seth for help.
Akbar could not believe as to how Dhanna could earn so much by counting waves at sea.
Akbar asked Dhanna for the help.

Dhanna: Badshah, Take as much as you want but this time around I will not change my profession.

Akbar: Ok, but tell me how did you earn money by counting Water waves at sea.

Dhanna: Very simple, I used to stop merchant's ships & boats far  away from sea shore. I showed them your orders that I  was counting waves & their ships & boats would disturb or break the waves hence their ships or boats should stay away. Badshah, these merchants then used to bribe me to let them reach the shore & unload their merchandise.

So Badshah understood that Dhanna Seth can earn by engaging in manipulations & bribery from any profession.

Demonetisation or no demonetisation, the Dhanna Seths of our society will always find a way to earn & accumulate black money.

12/3/16, 6:40 AM - Kashif: People who  do not want free migration of labor or talent are the ones who want to exploit it.

12/3/16, 8:52 PM - ANUPAM: Yet another Master stroke from Modi Govt. ! üëäüò∑

Government is going to change specifications for 'Condoms'

All companies have been instructed to have special latex coated lubricant. Every person who will buy packet will have to produce marriage certificate. Marriage certificate will be changed to e-certificate. 

With every purchase seller will have to put marriage e certificate number. This will be linked to registered mobile number, of spouse..!!

As soon as condom is purchased, a message will be sent to registered mobile number so that it is ensured that people are having legitimate sex. This is to ensure that morality of society is guarded.

And a ink  mark will be put on the Dick .. which will remain for 1 month.. only 4 condoms allowed to be bought a month .. only the govt can screw us more than that 

Issued in public interest üôàüò∑üòÇ

12/4/16, 7:32 AM - ANUPAM: No Need to Give Details

Most of us avoid using online transaction and card payment because it ask for the bank account details. For card transaction, you give card number, validity period and CVV number. Whereas net banking transaction expose your bank account details
12/4/16, 7:32 AM - ANUPAM: But the UPI solves this problem. The payment through the UPI does not require the card details or bank account details. You have to only give the virtual payment address. the virtual payment address is similar to our email ID. e. g Ramesh45@icicibank, 9876543210@axis. It is easy to remember this ID.
12/4/16, 7:34 AM - ANUPAM: 4. More Secure
What if someone overlooks your PIN while you punch it at the POS terminal. What if the website steal your credit card data and use it for the international transaction.

The UPI has minimized this concern. Actually It is more secure than the present mode of transaction. In the transaction through the UPI, you never share you bank account details. You do not enter your credit card number or CVV. You only give a virtual payment address which does not give any clue about your bank account.

Also the authentication takes place at your smartphone. It is done by punching the two different PINs. You can easily make it discrete while typing at your smartphone.
12/4/16, 7:34 AM - ANUPAM: 5. Instant Transfer

The UPI is based on IMPS platform. Thus It works 24 x7. You can make payment any time. There is no restriction of holiday or odd¬†hours. The bank strike will also not affect the UPI payments.

6. One UPI App Many Accounts

After the UPI mobile app, you do not need multiple apps for multiple bank account. A single UPI would serve for many bank accounts. You can link many bank accounts in a UPI based app.

Because of the multiple accounts at one place, you can pay by using any of the account. You can also set the default account for the payment.
12/4/16, 7:35 AM - ANUPAM: . Immediate Registration of Payee

The registration of new payee for the online fund transfer takes some time. This time varies form half an hour to 24 hours. However, the UPI doesn‚Äôt have such waiting period. You can instantly transfer fund to a new payee.

7. Money Collection Facility

If you ¬†have given a service or product to someone and want the payment, what would be way to ask for the money? You will send a person or make a call.

You would agree that getting money from a party is always tough. There can be numerous excuses. But, the UPI would give more power in the hands of biller and It would not be easy for the client to give excuses.

The money collection facility of the UPI sends a message directly to the party. This message is sent via the bank. It only asks approval for the payment. If the client approves, the money would be remitted instantly.
12/4/16, 7:36 AM - ANUPAM: Most of the merchants don‚Äôt have the card swiping machine. Let me tell you that this machine is called as the POS terminal.

So, small merchant don‚Äôt keep POS terminal because it is costly. They have to pay for the machine. Along with this they have to pay the service charge for each transaction. It varies from 1.25% to 2.5% of the transaction value.

But, UPI would do the same work with negligible cost. AS UPI operates through the smartphone, anyone can collect money without spending for the machine. Also, the transaction cost is mere 50 paise, It is very low compared to the POS terminal.
12/4/16, 7:36 AM - Satish: Bhai UPS ka  link bhej

12/4/16, 7:38 AM - ANUPAM: 11. UPI would Replace Many Digital Wallets

Digital wallet has eased the online payments. The mobile recharge, rail tickets, online shopping has become very smooth because of the digital wallets. But the number of such wallets are increasing. Paytm, Freecharge, Flipkart and IRCTC, Everyone want you to keep the digital wallet. So it become hassle to maintain more than one wallet.

The UPI would end this hassle as well. The payment through the UPI is as easy as payment through the wallets. But a single app is enough to pay anywhere. Also, the UPI does not ask money in advance. Rather, your money remains in the bank account and keeps earning the interest. Digital wallets don‚Äôt give any interest.
12/4/16, 7:39 AM - Satish: Bhai

12/4/16, 10:14 AM - ANUPAM: Using UPI app for banking :( Government of India initiative towards cashless banking )

http://upipayments.co.in/upi-benefits/

Advantages : 
1. Government owned
2. Instant transfer up to 1 lakh
3. Less transaction charges( Free!.)  compared to debit card(1-1.5%)
4. You can also request money
5. No need to add payee. You can directly send to bank account of other person ( if he/she is not having UPI)
6. Your money doesn't get locked in e wallet( like paytm,free charge,ola money,mobiqwik)..if you are already using one of these definitely UPI is a much better option.
7. Transferring is as easy as whatsapp..
8.Cash back of 100 on your first transaction.



Keep following with yourself :

A. mobile with your registered  sim with your bank( on which you get debit/credit SMS)
B. Debit card( for one time registration and setting mpin.)
C . Download UPI App from play store ( any UPI app would work but phone pe is really good and easy. )
Link( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonepe.app)



1.First set application pin
2. Create VPa id( eg. Sudhir123@ybl)
2. Add your bank account( app will give you option of choosing among 23 banks, choose your bank)
3. Set up your MPIN with debit card details(one time only)
If already set and you Dont remember..choose reset option..
You have to enter debit card details and onetime OTP for setting MPIN.

Get started!..

Clink on send option
( you can send to bank account of person ,who is not using this app or you can just transfer to id of person ( who has created this VPA eg. Send to sudhir81@ybl)



You can now easily send money to bank accounts by using MPIN only.!
You can also collect money from others.



Troubleshooting issues
1)For SBI maestro cards : Enter expiry date as 1/49.

2) Follow instructions for dual sim.

3) if adding your bank  doesn't show ur account number ,call up your bank for registering for mobile banking. In many cases it can be simply done by downloading ur banks app from play store.( eg. Imobile,yes bank) In some cases you have to call up customer care.in some case register at ATM.

4) it is not working for I phones as of now..

Kindly forward so that more and more people can use it and digital /cashless India get started with this movement

Vaise Quran aur bible me Mohammed aur Jesus ke pehle prophets se koi dikkat nahi hai.
Uske baad hai ..see how ahmadiyas and Mormons are prosecuted for making these claims.

12/4/16, 9:50 PM - Kashif: Hinduism is more inclusive and free as a religion. Not bounded by the diktat . And you are correct, why should there be a full stop after Mohammad . It is like saying the generations after that will be morons and stupid to be not able to give rise to a new prophet.lol
12/4/16, 9:54 PM - ANUPAM: http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/31969/dr-abdus-salam-and-all-the-wrong-choices-pakistan-made/

The story of only Nobel prize winner from Pakistan.
His fault,he was an ahmadiya.
12/4/16, 9:55 PM - ANUPAM: This statement, however, couldn‚Äôt wash out the stain of guilt that the subsequent governments of Pakistan and the entire nation still carry. While the entire world applauded him, Salam was never regarded as a hero in his own country. He‚Äôs considered the opposite ‚Äì a traitor.

What we did to Salam is shameful to say the least. When he returned to Pakistan after receiving the Nobel Prize, no one received him at the airport. Right wing propaganda concocted conspiracy theories to accuse him of nuclear espionage. When he was invited to Quaid-e-Azam University for his lecture, he was¬†threatened¬†by the fundamentalist students. Ziaul Haq¬†refused to endorse¬†the candidature of Salam as a Director General of UNESCO even though Salam visited nearly 30 countries in 1987 and gained their support. In 1988, the then Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, refused to meet him after making him¬†wait for two days¬†in a hotel. Similarly, Nawaz Sharif, in his first term of premiership, conveniently¬†ignored Salam¬†while mentioning the distinguished alumni of Government College, Lahore while addressing its convocation. Had Salam given up his Pakistani nationality, he would have easily avoided such humiliations, but he remained a Pakistani national until his last breath.
12/4/16, 9:56 PM - ANUPAM: All of this took a toll on him, and in last years of his life, he became the victim of a¬†neurological disorder¬†and was confined to a wheelchair. He died in Oxford, England on November 21, 1996. He was buried in Pakistan on his request. No government official attended¬†his funeral. His misery didn‚Äôt end with his death. The epitaph of his tombstone was defaced as a final disgrace to remove the word ‚ÄòMuslim‚Äô¬†from it
12/4/16, 9:58 PM - ANUPAM: What you do when country you love, you want to spend your last days in, die in..
Disowns you..just because of your sect.
This is why Pakistan has become a monstrosity. Original ISIS 1.0
12/4/16, 9:58 PM - ANUPAM: Till now, Yuvraj Singh was leading a 'Hazel' free life...

Now 'Keech Keech' begins....üòú
12/4/16, 10:20 PM - Kashif: The way the state of Pakistan and sunnis of Pakistan treat ahmadiya's in Pakistan is deplorable, shameful and inhumane and not to mention "un-Islamic".
12/4/16, 10:21 PM - Kashif: But then again we are not trying to become like Pakistan? Are we?
12/4/16, 10:21 PM - Kashif: Pakistan is a failed state in all respect.

You know kashif , imagine all decades till 2000.

Every year there would be riots..there was not even BJP then..
Then 2002 happened..then in 2014 muzaffarnagar happened..
Then dadri..

Point I am trying to make is, irrespective of what media tells you India is still much better nation for minorities than it was 20 years back.
12/4/16, 10:43 PM - Satish: 200 percent Correct
12/4/16, 10:44 PM - Satish: Best country for Minorities

12/4/16, 10:45 PM - ANUPAM: Plus some fake events are reported..

Remember multiple church attacks in Delhi in 2014.

Lot of what we hear about intolerance is contempt of lutyen liberals at having power snatched away from them.

12/4/16, 10:48 PM - ANUPAM: I vividly remember  how Obama was shamed at his being Muslim allegation..was almost apologetic..and had to prove his allegiance to church.
12/4/16, 10:56 PM - ANUPAM: http://m.timesofindia.com/city/jaipur/Islamic-countries-shut-door-but-India-welcomed-us-Rohingyas/articleshow/48181384.cms

Perhaps nobody would tell you but 15000 burma persecutef rohingya Muslims were given refuge in India between 2013-15. When neither Bangladesh or
Pakistan welcomed them ( their fault , they looked like chinkis- hence discriminated.Look how much hazara genocide happens in Pakistan)

12/6/16, 8:05 AM - ANUPAM: In bad taste..
Why wish death on even ur opponents
12/6/16, 8:06 AM - ANUPAM: #AmazonGo ‚Äì Amazon‚Äôs latest offerings. A shop without check in and check out, where your amazon wallet and enhanced AI, allows you to pick up what you want, and walk out of the door. The system, takes care of everything from entry to the shop, to counting picks, to calculating totals, and deducting it from the amazon wallet. The first store has already been in operation for a year. They are planning to roll it out.
12/6/16, 8:07 AM - ANUPAM: There are no consistent estimates for how many people work in the world, there are estimates of as high as 70% of the population is occupied with some work or the other, mostly informal, others talk about a ‚Äú global labour force of 3.2 billion ‚Äù in 2030; and, there is an estimate of 1.3 billion people in full time employment by Gallup. This is a 2013 figure. And, I seriously don‚Äôt see the figure going up drastically. Gains in one part of the world, would be off set by losses in another. About One fifth (19% if you want accuracy) of the population is in formal employment. And, the rest is in informal employment. And, more of the 1.3 billion jobs will be lost.
12/6/16, 8:08 AM - ANUPAM: But, is efficiency everything ? Should corporate profits be at the expense of social stability. Think of India, 70% of the population under 35. There are large plants that i have visited, that have less than a dozen full time staff. It is all automated. And, they get in contract workers (no benefits) when demand goes up. The rest of the time it is only machines. What happens to the jobs? What happens to the adjoining areas of the factory? Very often land and other tax breaks are offered to companies to set up in the hope it will bring in jobs. Highly skilled jobs
12/6/16, 8:08 AM - ANUPAM: Do governments even have a plan for future jobs (i am hoping they are discussing with industry and figuring what these jobs are) ? for training people from now on. I don‚Äôt know the answers to this. I wish I did. But, i would be very curious to know whether you think your job (not personally but the function that you perform) will be taken over (or not) by the machines. Why is all this important? because if a world with 1/5 people in full time employment is scary ‚Äì because there are raging fires where ever there are no jobs (crime, riots, rebellion, civil war) ‚Äì a world with even fewer jobs in even scarier.

12/6/16, 11:25 AM - ANUPAM: A court order
Jayalalithaa had barely completed two years as Chief Minister in her first term (1991-96) when she faced a major problem. The Madras High Court, in the light of the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in 1992 that the quantum of reservation should not exceed 50 per cent, directed the State to bring it down to 50 per cent from academic year 1994-1995.
This led to demands for Constitutional protection for the scheme. In November 1993, the Assembly adopted the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of seats in educational Institutions and of appointments or posts in the services under the State) Bill, 1993 [now known as Tamil Nadu Act of 1994].
Meetings in Delhi
In June 1994, Jayalalithaa led a delegation of parties and impressed upon then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to refer the Bill to President Shankar Dayal Sharma.
A month later, the Presidential assent came. She also stepped up pressure on the Centre to bring in a Constitutional amendment to include the Tamil Nadu Act in the Ninth Schedule so that its validity could not be challenged. By the end of August 1994, the Act became a part of the Ninth Schedule. The development fetched her the title of ‚ÄòSamooga Neethi Kaatha Veeranganai‚Äô (The leader who upheld social justice)
12/6/16, 11:25 AM - ANUPAM: Creamy layer included
Jayalalithaa, on returning to power in May 2011, took one more decision. Two months later, her Cabinet accepted the recommendation of the State Backward Classes Commission for continuing the 69 per cent quota without excluding the creamy layer. However, with the matter in the Supreme Court, the final word is yet to be said on the 1994 Act
12/6/16, 11:25 AM - Maaruti: Sir Aise mat Jalaiye
12/6/16, 11:26 AM - Maaruti: Bechari Acchi thi
12/6/16, 11:26 AM - ANUPAM: So 69 % quota without creamy layer..waah Tamil nadu

12/6/16, 11:27 AM - Maaruti: Ek Naya term ke liye
12/6/16, 11:28 AM - ANUPAM: No including quota in ninth schedule was her idea..
So that it couldn't be challenged in supreme court
Soon it was adopted by other states
12/6/16, 11:30 AM - ANUPAM: Due to this policies..
Tamil Nadu brahmins who were already feeling the heat got obliterated.

98% of open seats in Tamil nadu captured by OBCs now..(creamy layer ones!)
And no one bats an eyelid

12/6/16, 11:33 AM - ANUPAM: Jayalalitha brought lot of GOOD Populist schemes..

12/6/16, 11:37 AM - Maaruti: Kooch bhi kar lijiye
12/6/16, 11:38 AM - ANUPAM: 90% I think
12/6/16, 11:38 AM - Satish: So 10 percent is Brahmin?
12/6/16, 11:40 AM - ANUPAM: Let me Google % of people in open category
12/6/16, 11:40 AM - Satish: Yes
12/6/16, 11:40 AM - Satish: That's key
12/6/16, 11:42 AM - ANUPAM: The State said ‚Äúat the time when the law was made the population of backward classes was 87 per cent, consisted of BCs 68 per cent; Scheduled Castes 18 per cent, ST, 1 per cent.
12/6/16, 11:42 AM - ANUPAM: 13% general category

12/6/16, 11:47 AM - ANUPAM: There is an urgent necessity to revise the OBC Caste List due to the fact that 72.1% of the open category seats are taken by candidates belonging to castes currently classified as OBC in Tamilnadu.Only 53 of 2257 doctors will be from the general category in 2020.Only 53 of 2257 who apply for 100-odd open category PG seats in 2020 will be from general category.

12/6/16, 11:50 AM - ANUPAM: The Haryana assembly passed a bill on Tuesday to provide 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions to Jats and five other castes in the state.

It will further increase the quota in the state to 67%, which is impermissible in view of the 1992 Supreme Court judgment in the Indira Sawhney case (Mandal case) prescribing a 50% ceiling

12/6/16, 11:55 AM - ANUPAM: Rajasthan,Gujarat,haryana all have now 68% quota in educational institute and jobs by placing them under ninth schedule. All were enacted between 2014-16.

Putting increased 69% quota in ninth schedule to bypass supreme court was jaylalita's idea.

It was done in 1994.

India follows in 2014.
12/6/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: Which governments did it ...must loose elections
12/6/16, 11:56 AM - Satish: Chor government
12/6/16, 11:57 AM - ANUPAM: General category percentage in India around 20-23%.

So open seats should be reduced to 20%.80% tak badhaane ka scope hai.
12/6/16, 11:57 AM - Maaruti: Sir China me Reservation hai Kya ??
12/6/16, 11:59 AM - ANUPAM: Next step eliminate creamy layer or make cap so high that it is virtually eliminated.

12/6/16, 12:03 PM - ANUPAM: And since these quotas are vertical..multiplier effect..

Continuing on the Tamilnadu Medical data story, here is the situation in Post Graduate Medical in various colleges in TN. For sake of convenience I have only analyzed colleges with greater than 10 PG positions including surgical and super specialty.

Key Findings

Stanley, Kilpauk, Coimbatore have ZERO students from open categoryThere are only EIGHT PG doctors from general category that will graduate in this batch of nearly 300.As quotas are applied at successive stages ‚Äì they have a cumulative effect.Unless a judicial doctrine of scrutiny is evolved, this will continue. Remember that any change today ‚Äì will impact doctors only in 2023 to 2025.
12/6/16, 12:05 PM - ANUPAM: Kindly spread information aboyt this assholery going in in Tamil Nadu and will gradually be spread in Rajasthan,gujrrat,haryana in next 20 years.
12/6/16, 12:05 PM - ANUPAM: Only 2.5% seats captured by people from open category in Tamil Nadu in PG. The general % is around 7%.
12/6/16, 12:06 PM - ANUPAM: So these guys are not even proportionally represented.

What the fuck is minority.!
12/6/16, 12:08 PM - Satish: Parivartan  Required..
12/6/16, 12:11 PM - Satish: But question is which parties making this go from 50 to 69?
12/6/16, 12:13 PM - ANUPAM: I am not hopeful about it all..but we can spread awareness so that everyone knows they are getting screwed..and how things will turn out for them in future

Would also advise non-BC guys to go in private entrepreneurship like Muslims, and spread their dynasty in private sector by Bhai bhateejawad (like 50% of media in India brahmins)
12/6/16, 12:13 PM - ANUPAM: Similarly in other sectors.
12/6/16, 12:14 PM - ANUPAM: Keep quiet..
( so that quotas dont get in jobs in private sector schools like right to education)...........
capture the private. 

Make dynasties there.
12/6/16, 12:16 PM - ANUPAM: 53% OBC, 22.5 % SC ST..obviously every political party will support it .till it gets to 78-80% no.?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that he blundered by demonetising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes without much thought. The Prime Minister made this admission to Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) when the latter met him on November 19.

Prime Minister admitted demonetisation was itself a blunder and that he should have paid much more attention to it before introducing it, said a source who knew about the meeting. Though the Prime Minister said things should improve soon, he asked KCR to support the move at least in public.¬†

12/7/16, 5:37 PM - ANUPAM: How to use paytm for those having non smartphone.

A)

1. Log on to paytm.com
2. Create an account for them
https://paytm.com/login( by entering their mobile number and account password)
Password has one number and one special character line
abcd1@
- tell them to write this  password on piece of paper
4. Once you have done this..
The mobile number you have entered will get an OTP
5.Enter OTP on signup page and their account will be registered.

6. Congrats! Their account is made in 1 minute ..you can now transfer money to their account..

B)

How to use paytm to transfer money on non-smartphone or without internet

Step1. Dial this number from registered mobile number 
1800-1800-1234
It will ask you about setting an MPIN
Confirm.
Step2.
Now you will get a call from paytm to set ur 4 digit MPIN
Set it.
Write down MPIN on a piece of papet

Step3. Congrats now you can use paytm to transfer money without internet and on non-smartphoned.

Step4. Dial 1800-1800-1234 again
Select option to transfer money to paytm(generally it is 1)

Enter the mobile number of paytm account you want to send to.. 

Enter the transfer amount .Eg. 10

You will be asked to enter MPIN

Congratulations.. You will get confirmation of ur transaction.


Thus a person with non-smartphone or smartphone without internet can successfully use it to transfer to money of others.

Kindly try this once and spread widely to create account of those having feature phones(your maid/driver/vegetable vendor)
Teaching them how to transfer to other account on feature phone without internet only.

Kindly spread

Troubleshooting:
1) sometimes the number 
1800-1800-1234 is busy , try it a few times..you will get through
2) sometimes it says you are not registered.. Dont worry dial again.

Considering paytm has become a payment bank now,gives interest up to 6% ,can deposit up to 100000(on KYC- their agents come at home,will give you checkbook n debit card too) and up to 20000(without KYC)
It is a valid option for marginalized section of society.

It also helps you,because you can transfer money to their account without internet for free, and they can do the same.


Spread widely,make it viral.Thanks!

12/7/16, 8:31 PM - ANUPAM: Our girls have been asked to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. But they are telling customers that they will not accept those after this week. Therefore there is a huge rush of customers. Although sex workers in top categories are facing no problem but those who take only Rs 300 to Rs 400 are facing great difficulty, said Bharati, the mentor of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, a sex workers' organization which has 1.3 lakh registered sex workers under it across Bengal.

Sex workers who charge below 500 are facing tough time as they have hardly got any customers in last two days.

Prospective customers first inquire whether the sex workers will accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. If we say no we will lose the customer. We have to accept the notes and Durbar and Usha bank had assured us that our money will not go in waste, said Rekha a sex worker.

In the last two days, sex workers in and around Sonagachi have deposited more than Rs 55 lakh in Usha Multipurpose Cooperative Bank, which was formed and is run by former sex workers in 2001 for women in the same trade.

12/8/16, 6:15 PM - ANUPAM: Starting today, you will not be charged any service tax when you use your credit or debit card for upto Rs 2,000.¬† Currently, you pay 15% as the tax on these transactions. The exemption is part of the government's all-out initiative to steer the country away from a cash economy to digital transactions.

12/8/16, 6:22 PM - ANUPAM: No it means at higher value transactions cash and digital are on same level..no..
12/8/16, 6:23 PM - ANUPAM: Plus government won't subsidize card payments more than 2000..obviously otherwise risk of more losses.
12/8/16, 6:26 PM - ANUPAM: Suppose you worth 2100 worth pizza..
Then 105 rupees service tax both on cash n card..
Apart from VAT..
Meaning net cost 2205+VAT

Suppose you buy 500 worth pizza..
Meaning
You have to pay 525 + VAT in cash and 500 + VAT if by card..
So around 25 ka discount..no.?

12/9/16, 7:55 PM - Satish: There was a large pond in which some violent crocodiles were living. The king's soldiers could not catch crocodiles in the muddy waters. The king decided to get the pond water dried to catch the crocodiles. But at the same time it was decided to fill the pond with clean water so that small fishes in the pond should not die. 
As soon as the water was drained, the amphibian crocodile ran into the woods. But poor little fish were found squirming and groaning in anguish in the absence of water.
The king's soldiers explained to the fish that this step was necessary to catch the violent crocodile, and so have patience for a few days as clean water is coming.
Now the question is,
Whether the fish will survive till the clean water comes?
Who else will feast on dying fishes?
Whether the King‚Äôs soldiers will be able to catch crocodile?
Whether pond would be barricaded so that after replenishing with clean water crocodiles do not return to pond and sacrifice of small fishes is also not futile?
Whether king should have taken preparatory steps for sufficient clean water before undertaking this public-friendly measure?
The story ahead is live on all news channels, keep watching .....

12/9/16, 9:20 PM - ANUPAM: The chief source of revenue was the land tax which was one-sixth to one-fourth of the produce and was collected by the revenue officer, agronomoi, who measured the land, levied the tax and collected it.

The second major source of income was toll- tax which was imposed on all articles (except grain, cattle and a few other items). This tax was approximately 10 percent. Shudras, artisans and others who survived on manual labour had to work free for one day in each month.
12/9/16, 9:20 PM - ANUPAM: Ashoka

12/9/16, 9:23 PM - ANUPAM: Hence, in assessment year 2014-2015, 0.15 per cent of the population paid 77 per cent of the income tax paid by individuals.

12/9/16, 9:24 PM - Satish: Yes
12/9/16, 9:24 PM - ANUPAM: In assessment year 2014-2015, around 19.18 lakh individuals paid Rs. 1.47 lakh crore as income tax in total. The total tax paid by individuals during the year was Rs. 1.91 lakh crore. So, a very small number of people paid around 77 per cent of the individual income tax. Let's look at Figure 7.

12/9/16, 9:51 PM - ANUPAM: http://swarajyamag.com/economy/not-just-indian-exceptionalism-the-moral-case-for-abolishing-income-tax
12/9/16, 9:53 PM - ANUPAM: However, there is an even stronger moral case for abolishing income tax for individuals.
The problem with taxing individuals is that the costs that go into earning that income seldom get amortised. When you tax a corporation or business, the costs and investments incurred in running that business are deducted from revenues and only the surpluses (profits) are taxed.
Now consider the case of an individual. To make an individual capable of earning an income, the invested costs from birth to working age are enormous. It can take anything from 14-25 years to make an individual productive. None of these costs are deductible from the income an individual earns. If the logic of deducting costs before taxation is valid for companies, why not individuals? Since it is impossible to arrive at these costs, which can vary from individual to individual, the second-best way is to not tax individual incomes, whether earned by physical work, mental work, or a combination of the two.
Then there is the question of tax inequity. I am not the first one to point out that almost anywhere in the world, labour income is often taxed more than capital-based income. Rajiv Shastri of Pramarica Asset Managers made this point some time ago in
Firstpost , and many more people have also done so.
Ace investor Warren Buffett has pointed out that as an owner of a business, his tax rate is lower than that of his secretary . This is because income earned from investing capital is often taxed at a lower rate than income earned from employment.
In India, long-term capital gains attract zero tax. And dividends are taxed at a lower rate than incomes in the highest bracket. Interest paid is a deductible item in business, but interest paid by individuals (whether paid for buying a home or to own a car) does not get this kind of tax break (except for interest payments on home loans upto Rs 2 lakh).
To correct the tax handicap suffered by individuals as against businesses, the logical way is to abolish income tax for individuals, with taxes kicking in only after high levels of income are achieved (say, above Rs 1 crore per annum). Even here, it should be a flat tax. Individuals earning interest income and dividends from accumulated capital can be subject to tax deduction at source at moderate rates of, say, 20 per cent.
The third moral argument to abolish income tax on individuals is even simpler: you cannot make millions of hard working Indians criminals by calling them tax evaders. In the last few days, one has heard anecdotal stories of Ola and Uber drivers earning Rs 50-80k a month by working over-time and at odd hours. A maid working for Rs 3,000 each in 8-10 houses would also be in the taxable bracket. But the thought that they may be tax evaders may not even have crossed the minds of the Ola driver or our maid. It is wrong to make hard working people tax criminals. That is something you do only to the super-rich, not the aspiring or middle classes.

Indian IT sector is being scapegoated for abuse of the visa programme that actually pervades the entire industry

It‚Äôs true that almost all the programmers the Indian companies hire are foreign workers, and that they offshore some of their work. But for many US companies, most of their programmers are foreign workers, too. Photo: Mint

It is amazing, in this racially enlightened century, that we still see members of the US Congress demonizing an ethnic group. Yet that is what happened when the Senate adopted a provision in the immigration Bill singling out Indian and Indian-American information-technology (IT) companies that have operations in the US with punitive restrictions on H-1B work visas. By contrast, the legislation expanded access to the visa to others in the technology industry.

Indian and Indian-American (collectively Indian below) IT businesses are being scapegoated for abuse of the visa programme‚Äîusing it for cheap, immobile labour‚Äîthat actually pervades the entire industry. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who was one of the gang of eight senators who oversaw the Bill, accused Indian businesses of usurping the programme. His Democratic Senate colleague Charles Schumer of New York even used the term chop shops in referring to Indian employers.

The word Indian, of course, doesn‚Äôt appear in the text of the Bill, which essentially defines the targeted class as those companies that rent out computer programmers to other companies. But those businesses are virtually all run by ethnic Indians; Indian-Americans lead the majority of them, though many of the largest companies are based in India. Schumer has cited a number of specific India-based operations, such as¬†Infosys Ltd, in his speeches.

Distorting facts

Why gang up on the Indians? The technology industry has publicly called on Congress to enact punitive legislation against Indian companies, a strategy that appears aimed at diverting attention from the entire industry‚Äôs own widespread abuse of the visas.

Propaganda typically relies on distortion of facts. In this case, the argument is based on excellent research by professor Ron Hira of the Rochester Institute of Technology on the Indian companies. Although Hira says abuse pervades the entire industry and he opposes making the Indians the target of H-1B visa changes, his work was hijacked to justify the attacks on them in the Senate Bill.

It‚Äôs true that almost all the programmers the Indian companies hire are foreign workers, and that they offshore some of their work. But for many US companies, most of their programmers are foreign workers, too; just plug software engineer EBay into LinkedIn‚Äôs search engine for a dramatic demonstration. And those companies do offshoring as well.

Most important, both Indian and other businesses use the H-1B programme for cheap labour. Although the Indian companies hire at the low end‚Äîtypically holders of bachelor‚Äôs degrees‚Äîwhile other companies often hire at the master‚Äôs level, both types of companies are underpaying at those respective levels.

And the underpayment is legal. Even Schumer has conceded that the Indian-owned businesses are doing nothing illegal. All employers can abuse the visa programme by using some gaping loopholes, which includes the definition of the legally required wage. Other IT companies aren‚Äôt going to pass up the loopholes in H-1B rules any more than they would leave money on the table by not making full use of tax-code loopholes.

My own research, published in the academic journal¬†Migration Letters, has shown that non-Indian companies use the visas to acquire cheap labour, saving about 20% in an apples-to-apples comparison‚Äîi.e., young foreign workers versus young Americans‚Äîand as much as 50% for hiring young H-1B visa holders instead of older Americans. A 2001 National Research Council report, commissioned by Congress, also found that underpayment of the visa holders is an industrywide practice.
12/10/16, 5:19 PM - ANUPAM: US companies also abuse the related green-card process, which renders a foreign worker immobile for the several years during which the green-card approval is pending. The employer doesn‚Äôt want engineers leaving for a competitor during an urgent project. The beholden workers can‚Äôt move around to find the best salary, and this holds wages down. Sankar Mukhopadhyay and David Oxborrow of the University of Nevada have shown that workers attain significantly higher salaries after their green cards finally come through and they gain their freedom.

Because Indian companies only rarely sponsor their foreign workers for green cards, the rest of technology industry arguably abuses the foreign workers even more than the Indian ones do.

Hira projects that if the Senate Bill‚Äôs provision is enacted, the biggest beneficiaries will be companies such as¬†International Business Machines Corp.¬†(IBM), much of whose work involves the same programmer rental business model as that of Indian companies. This would seem to be the ultimate in Capitol Hill cynicism: Squash the little guys to help the ones with deep pockets

12/10/16, 5:59 PM - Abhishek: Please read everything carefully and try to find out why??????
He is selling to put that money in paytm banking payment system
Which cant get RBI clearance because he paytm is basically owned by chines firm...
12/10/16, 6:03 PM - ANUPAM: Paytm bank and paytm commerce are two separate entities.

Paytm bank has 51% Indian share ,it also has in principle approval for RBI already.

Paytm e-commerce, ( mobile recharge,movie ticket )is majority owned by Chinese.
12/10/16, 6:04 PM - ANUPAM: But problem is paytm e-commerce is very tightly integrated with paytm banking.
May be they would separate who knows ?
12/10/16, 6:06 PM - Abhishek: He is generating money for that banking system...
What the issue then?
12/10/16, 6:08 PM - ANUPAM: If you go to paytm app..both entities are very tightly integrated..infact most people use paytm for discounts,recharge and cashbacks till now..(of course that might change if and when they start issuing debit cards,cheques)
12/10/16, 6:10 PM - ANUPAM: Personally I think running a bank requires much more money than sharma ji has..
Best of luck to him..

My only worry is that I hope paytm is not taken over by a Chinese company.
12/10/16, 6:11 PM - Abhishek: One day he will sell everything
12/10/16, 6:11 PM - ANUPAM: I also think RBI should launch its own e-wallets directly link to account.

SBI buddy is very ghatiya.
12/10/16, 6:12 PM - ANUPAM: I prefer transferring by mobile banking to other person's account easily by UPI as I have routinely recommended here.
12/10/16, 6:13 PM - Maaruti: Yes and everyone should have 1 bank account
12/10/16, 6:13 PM - Maaruti: Account in RBI
12/10/16, 6:13 PM - Maaruti: Bas
12/10/16, 6:13 PM - Maaruti: Baaki Sab Bank ki MKC
12/10/16, 6:16 PM - ANUPAM: Advantage of e-wallets
1) you only need mobile number like whatsapp..

UPI/Bank
1) you need both mobile number + ur bank account linked to mobile number..

While travelling in auto I have many times opened other guys paytm account in 30 second from my browser and transferred money to his account.which he can use later .

So e-wallets are easy to install without account and have low liability.

12/10/16, 6:55 PM - ANUPAM: Every ball also matters.
Sachin won more tests than dravid.
Dravid saved more tests than sachin.
12/10/16, 6:56 PM - ANUPAM: As mentioned above, perhaps the most significant aspect of Dravid's Test career was that the runs he scored contributed significantly to India's wins, mainly overseas. Overall, Dravid scored 5131 runs in¬†Test wins, next only to Tendulkar's 5594. However, in overseas Test wins, he was often India's main man, even more than Tendulkar. India won 15 Tests abroad during Dravid's career (excluding matches in Bangladesh and Zimbabwe), and in those games he scored 1577 runs at 65.70 - both aggregate and average is higher than Tendulkar's.
12/10/16, 6:56 PM - ANUPAM: Dravid was far less talented than sachin..but a wall in his own special way
12/10/16, 6:59 PM - Maaruti: It's wrong to say that Dravid was less talented , versatile may be , but talent definitely not
12/10/16, 7:01 PM - ANUPAM: True

12/11/16, 6:50 PM - ANUPAM: All such rulings are in keeping with the law laid down in 1976 by a five-judge Constitution bench in a case involving reservations in an educational institution. Somebody who had been born as a Christian was allowed to take admission in Guntur Medical College in the SC quota as his parents had reconverted to Hinduism and rejoined the fold of the Madiga caste. The judgment written by Justice PN Bhagwati said: "It is for the members of the caste to decide whether or not to admit a person within the caste. Since the caste is a social combination of persons governed by its rules and regulations, it may, if its rules and regulations so provide, admit a new member just as it may expel an existing member."
12/11/16, 6:51 PM - ANUPAM: OK so you can convert ..but you need to be accepted by that caste..

Meaning for Gharwaapsi to dalits we need 4-5 dalit villages.
12/11/16, 6:51 PM - Satish: Pichraa India ...
12/11/16, 6:52 PM - ANUPAM: 4-6 RSS dalit villages..who will accept anyone doing gharwaapsi..

12/11/16, 7:02 PM - ANUPAM: The Supreme Court on Thursday held that a Dalit Christian or Muslim converting to Hinduism will be entitled to reservation benefits as long as it can be proved that his forefathers belonged to a caste categorised as a scheduled caste. This builds on an earlier judgement (Guntur Medical College versus Y. Mohan Rao) which held that a person need not be born a Hindu to get scheduled caste status. If his Dalit parents had converted out of Hinduism, he still legally regains the caste of his parents if and when he converts to Hinduism. The Mohan Rao verdict, however, set the limit at one generation: the parents had to have been Hindus once for the child to be eligible for scheduled caste benefits. Thursday‚Äôs ruling removes that limit: now scheduled caste benefits can be gained no matter how many generations back the Dalit ancestors left Hinduism, as long as the caste can be verified.
In these times of ghar wapsi this new judgement puts a formal judicial seal on the concept of ‚Äúreconversion‚Äù. In fact, the word ‚Äúreconversion‚Äù is explicitly used in the order. Not only that, it also seems to incentivise ‚Äúreconversion‚Äù with the hook of scheduled caste reservations
12/11/16, 7:02 PM - Satish: Sahi hai
12/11/16, 7:03 PM - ANUPAM: So basically a christian just has to lie that his ancestors were dalits..
12/11/16, 7:03 PM - Satish: Pom let's form a society

12/11/16, 7:04 PM - Maaruti: But most of the Goans were Sarashwat Brahmin
12/11/16, 7:06 PM - Satish: Yaar Maruti
12/11/16, 7:06 PM - Satish: Talk and aim is to convert Dalit muslim back
12/11/16, 7:06 PM - ANUPAM: Bribe one or two dalit sarpanch in noida..b

12/11/16, 9:04 PM - ANUPAM: Kejriwal is shocked at this news..satyendar jain ( health minister ) calls this negligence .haha..
May be they have never visited a medical college before..

India needs low-cost ventilators urgently. You see this scene playing day in day out in 90% medical colleges and government hospitals..
12/11/16, 9:07 PM - ANUPAM: But what is truly criminal here is no oxygen supply line..
So that patient gets his oxygen from cylinder. Many a times oxygen finishes , and relative is not aware and patient dies.
This doesn't happen in other medical colleges.
Some past medical superintendent of MAMC deserve to go to jail for no working oxygen supply in emergency
12/11/16, 9:09 PM - ANUPAM: <Media omitted>
12/11/16, 9:15 PM - ANUPAM: Health minister knows this issue. Was briefed about lack of ventilators three months back. Yet calls it doctors negligence.

These ministers throws doctors to wolves.
Why not just admit him garib hain humaari ventilator khareedne ki aukaat nahi hai
12/11/16, 9:32 PM - Abhishek: This is why i call 
KUTTA KEJRIWAL
12/11/16, 9:35 PM - Maaruti: Doctors of LNJP are so negligent that they can't inhale  Carbon Di oxide and exhale Oxygen , so that Oxygen can be supplied without Ventilators and Uninterrupted to the patient admitted in there .

Hence Death due to Negligence .

Very Good and logical article..
Especially see the criticism of golden UPA years and 2014-16
12/13/16, 7:57 AM - Satish: <Media omitted>
12/13/16, 8:08 AM - ANUPAM: Important for companies to secure their private e-mail servers. 
Or migrate them to cloud (amazon,azure)
Cyber security is a joke in this country..
12/13/16, 8:08 AM - ANUPAM: Gmail Facebook much secure than these servers
12/13/16, 8:09 AM - ANUPAM: Do you know that this legion group has all Apollo Hospitals data ..
Including patient details..
12/13/16, 8:10 AM - ANUPAM: http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/We-have-access-to-servers-like-that-of-Apollo-Hospitals-says-hacker-group-%E2%80%98Legion%E2%80%99/article16798246.ece
12/13/16, 8:10 AM - Satish: These are bunch of Sanghis
12/13/16, 8:10 AM - Satish: It seems
12/13/16, 8:10 AM - Satish: Yes I saw that yestedday
12/13/16, 8:10 AM - Satish: The target so far suggest Sanghi roots..
12/13/16, 8:11 AM - Satish: Else if neutral the real target is always government of such grps
12/13/16, 8:12 AM - ANUPAM: Doesn't matter whoever they are.
What matters is private e-mail servers are insecure,because companies (NDTV,congress it cell) dont spend on security.
12/13/16, 8:14 AM - ANUPAM: Legion itself means hacking ID of rich and famous..
No it is not..

ALWAYS celebrity hacked first..
Happened many times in USA
12/13/16, 8:15 AM - Satish: Snowden targeted celebrity?
12/13/16, 8:16 AM - Satish: And Ravish Kumar Barkha and Rahul. ...celebrity?
12/13/16, 8:27 AM - ANUPAM: Vijay mallya was hacked first,
Lalit modi's account was hacked also..
Expecting you to ignore these data points
12/13/16, 8:28 AM - ANUPAM: Snowden was private contractor of CIA..not a hacker..get your facts right..
He was a man who turned rogue
12/13/16, 8:29 AM - Satish: Not ignoring
12/13/16, 8:29 AM - Satish: Why only Ravish and Barkha
12/13/16, 8:30 AM - ANUPAM: Because both are on NDTV servers..
12/13/16, 8:30 AM - Satish: Why not chaudhary and Arnav
12/13/16, 8:30 AM - Satish: Ok
12/13/16, 8:30 AM - Satish: May be all other media has super servers
12/13/16, 8:31 AM - Satish: Mallaya NDTV  and Zee tv
12/13/16, 8:31 AM - ANUPAM: No one stops anybody..

12/13/16, 8:32 AM - Satish: Mallaya Lalit and Ndtv
12/13/16, 8:32 AM - Satish: Let's see who has HIV data
12/13/16, 8:32 AM - Satish: From Apollo
12/13/16, 8:32 AM - ANUPAM: So why sanghis have Apollo data ?
12/13/16, 8:32 AM - Satish: Look
12/13/16, 8:33 AM - Satish: What I wrote
12/13/16, 8:33 AM - Satish: I want to check what they reveal out of that data
12/13/16, 8:33 AM - Satish: Mallaya mails to congressi likely to come
12/13/16, 8:34 AM - ANUPAM: Because all these accounts were on Net4 companies servers which is one of largest web hosting server companies in India..
12/13/16, 8:34 AM - ANUPAM: Net4 should be sued
12/13/16, 8:34 AM - ANUPAM: They might blackmail you privately as well..who knows
12/13/16, 8:36 AM - ANUPAM: If I had access to your Apollo data, I would blackmail you by threatening to release your data to your employer..
and make money..instead of releasing it publicly
12/13/16, 8:40 AM - ANUPAM: Kabhi Sanghi ko log uneducated bolte hain..kabhi hacker..
Apni galtiyon ko chhupaane ke liye..
Now using this to rumour-monger about digital India..

It must be understood private e-mail servers and banking servers of RBI are completely different..
12/13/16, 8:41 AM - Satish: Sanghis are most educated lot

12/13/16, 9:04 AM - ANUPAM: I will tell you a secret 
Barkha,Ravish,Rajdeep and sagarika were awed/admired before they labelled every counter argument as sanghi/internet Hindu..

They are single handedly responsible for creating so many 'educated' sanghi in India..
On social media twitter/Facebook they are the most condescending to anyone who disagrees with their viewd
12/13/16, 9:06 AM - Satish: No one create anything except Brahma...these people are easy pawns for RSS to get polarisation required to make BJP in power...
12/13/16, 9:07 AM - ANUPAM: So Ravish/Barkha/Rajdeep are RSS agents
12/13/16, 9:07 AM - ANUPAM: And Sudhir chaudhary/Arnab jholachaap..üòã
Nice conspiracy theory
12/13/16, 9:18 AM - Satish: They are not agents..they are pivots of stupidity and which smart  shrweds build arguments
12/13/16, 9:26 AM - Maaruti: A quick look at Kalma Mater of Barkha Dutt and it becomes very clear why she is the way she is

12/13/16, 10:51 AM - Satish: Yes it's advantage BJP
12/13/16, 10:51 AM - Satish: But argument of Brahmin for Congress is outlandish

12/13/16, 12:54 PM - ANUPAM: In the first case he had referred to Kejriwal as ‚ÄúAalo‚Äù, meaning potato, a word which became synonymous with Kejriwal after allegations that it was a name given to him by a woman with whom he had an alleged extramarital affair. In the second case it appears Satyendar was taunting Kejriwal rather coarsely for indulging in only words and no action, even comparing him to a dog.
Jain may have deleted these embarrassing tweets, but they live on forever.

Eg. I didn't know too that paytm money bank could be transferred to bank account and is very easy..

Only other thing it should be made mandatory for every service provider to install a POS/ or qr code (digital receipt via paytm/UPI)..

12/14/16, 3:13 PM - ANUPAM: TN Govt Shocked by Former CM Jayalalitha Apollo Bill
December 10, 20168405

 
CM Jayalalitha Hospital Bill Shocked TN Govt: Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa and AIDMK Leader, who had been under treatment at Apollo Hospitals, Chennai for about 73 days. She was in Apollo Chennai since her hospitalization on September 22nd, 2016. As per our reports, medical expenses of the Jayalalithaa has crossed Rs 80 Crore during this period.
 
TN Govt Shocked by Former CM Jayalalithaa Hospital Bill !!!

According to the Media, the second floor of the Apollo Hospital with 30 rooms was vacated due to security issues. Going by the tariff by Apollo Hospital, per day rent for 30 rooms at Apollo has been known to be around Rs 1 crore. The charges exclude the consultation charges of 39 Apollo doctors, medicines, bills of Dr. Richard and his team who traveled from London many times, and the cost of a physiotherapist who flew from Singapore for Jayalalitha‚Äôs treatment.

Must Read: Shocking Cost of Jayalalitha's Heart Attack to the Tamil Nadu Ex-chequer.
 
Two Suite Rooms which was used by Jayalalithaa cost around Rs 52,600 per day. Eight out of the 28 remaining rooms are general wards. The cost for each bed varies from Rs 3,500 to Rs 5,200. Out of which, ten rooms are private wards, which cost nearly Rs 8,800 per day. The cost of suites varies from Rs 12,500 to Rs 26,000 per day.

Central Government will pay other charges like expenses of AIIMS Doctors. Altogether, at least Rs 1 crore per day has been spent for Amma‚Äôs hospitalization.

If patient has SBP between 80- 90 with crepts
Not to be used in less than 80..

Head to head trials were done with dobutamine..

No mortality benefits
12/14/16, 7:05 PM - ANUPAM: People use short term IV infusion of dobutamine frequently for these cases..

Don't use if systolic BP less than 80 will lead to further fall..

Was supposed to be less arrhythmogenic than dobutamine though..but again no benefits..

12/14/16, 7:10 PM - ANUPAM: Dobutamine best example
12/14/16, 7:11 PM - ANUPAM: Dopamine and Noradrenaline and Vasopressin in contrast are just inotropes
12/14/16, 7:11 PM - Kashif: So why would you use a vasodilator in chf. Isn't it counter productive
12/14/16, 7:13 PM - ANUPAM: There are cases of low cardiogenic output with pulmonary edema..you have to clear lungs as well..
12/14/16, 7:14 PM - ANUPAM: Yes it can lead to fall in BP..that is why use dobutamine only when SBP above 85-90
12/14/16, 7:15 PM - ANUPAM: If less than 80-85 use dopamine,NORAD,vasopressin..

12/14/16, 8:09 PM - ANUPAM: Analysis of data from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and India‚Äôs ministry of finance, spanning nearly 50 years from 1965 to 2013 across 35 countries, reveals that India is indeed an outlier. India‚Äôs tax-to-GDP ratio increased from 10.4% in 1965 to 17.2% in 2013. This includes both central and state tax revenues. The corresponding tax-to-GDP ratio for OECD countries (weighted by GDP) increased from 21% in 1965 to 33% in 2013. Purely in terms of a tax-to-GDP ratio, India has always been substantially lower than the average of OECD economies, over a 50-year period. Compared to a subset of OECD nations with lower GDP (Korea, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, Indonesia and Poland), India‚Äôs tax-to-GDP is still lower at 17% versus an average of 24% for these nations.
12/14/16, 8:10 PM - ANUPAM: the 25-year period from 1965 to 1990, India‚Äôs tax-to-GDP increased steadily from 10% to 16% while GDP increased 2.8-fold. In the subsequent 25-year period from 1991 to 2014, India‚Äôs tax-to-GDP stayed roughly constant between 16% and 17% while GDP increased 4.5-fold. It is puzzling to us that just as India broke away from its clich√©d Hindu rate of growth post the 1991 economic reforms to grow much more rapidly, its tax-to-GDP ratio stayed constant, belying those who would have predicted an increase. That, curiously, India‚Äôs rate of tax revenues did not grow commensurate with its GDP growth post the 1991 reforms is inexplicable.
12/14/16, 8:10 PM - ANUPAM: India‚Äôs direct to indirect tax ratio is roughly 35:65. This is in contrast to most OECD economies where the ratio is the exact opposite, 67:33 in favour of direct taxes. In the 50-year period of our analysis, India‚Äôs direct-to-indirect tax ratio has swung from a low of 13:87 to its current high of 35:65. For the OECD nations, throughout this 50-year period, the direct-to-indirect tax ratio has remained roughly constant in the range of 65:35. Again, is there a desired balance between direct and indirect taxes for an economy?

Economic literature lays down two principal views. The first view, which was popular in the 19th century and into the middle of the 20th century, is the ‚Äúdesirable balance‚Äù view‚Äîroughly, the idea that there should be something like a half-and-half split.

12/14/16, 8:26 PM - ANUPAM: In assessment year 2014-2015, around 19.18 lakh individuals paid Rs. 1.47 lakh crore as income tax in total. The total tax paid by individuals during the year was Rs. 1.91 lakh crore. So, a very small number of people paid around 77 per cent of the individual income tax. Let's look at Figure 7.
12/14/16, 8:27 PM - Satish: Bhai
12/14/16, 8:27 PM - Satish: I am asking
12/14/16, 8:27 PM - Satish: Total government tax is how much
12/14/16, 8:27 PM - Satish: Income tax will be 15 percent of it
12/14/16, 8:27 PM - Satish: So significant cut can be done
12/14/16, 8:27 PM - ANUPAM: I am talking about personal income tax..only 2 lakh crore
12/14/16, 8:28 PM - Satish: Yaar if they cut say 20 percent
12/14/16, 8:28 PM - Satish: It will 40000 crore
12/14/16, 8:28 PM - Satish: Which is nothing if total tax increase by 5 percent which will for sure...
12/14/16, 8:29 PM - Satish: So all in alll
12/14/16, 8:29 PM - ANUPAM: https://www.equitymaster.com/diary/detail.asp?date=11/07/2016&story=2&title=Who-Really-Pays-Income-Tax-in-India
12/14/16, 8:29 PM - ANUPAM: The effective rate of income tax paid by individuals in the assessment years under consideration are in the range of 9.2 per cent and 10.4 per cent. A major reason for this lies in the fact that a bulk of individuals who file income tax returns and declare their income, do not pay any income tax. Look at Figure 3
12/14/16, 8:29 PM - Satish: Good scenario for massive tax cut
12/14/16, 8:30 PM - ANUPAM: Effective tax rate as percent of income is just 10 percent..

Still so few taxes
12/14/16, 8:31 PM - ANUPAM: Payers
12/14/16, 8:31 PM - ANUPAM: Tax base hi nahi hai..
Ek se badh kar ek haraamkhor
12/14/16, 8:33 PM - ANUPAM: Further, an effective rate of income tax of close to 31 per cent for companies is not in line with the effective rate of income tax declared in the statement of revenue foregone published along with the budget every year.

For 2013-2014 (the tax return on the income earned during this financial year was filed in the assessment year 2014-2015), the effective rate of income tax was a much lower 23.22 per cent. I don't have an explanation for this anomaly.

Nevertheless, even an effective rate of 23.2 per cent, is significantly higher than an effective rate of 10.4 per cent for individuals. Lest individuals feel that they are getting away with a lower effective rate of income tax, that is not the case. What the government loses out on a lower effective rate of income tax, it more than makes up for through the service tax and other indirect taxes.

For starters, try looking at your restaurant bill for once.

12/15/16, 11:47 AM - ANUPAM: Now every time the American government introduces a tax increase, America gets agitated. It becomes a presidential election issue. The tax increases get blocked by congressmen/women of both parties. Obama himself gave up on trying to tax the upper middle class more and instead raised the corporate income tax[5]. In India in line with our roots we prefer a different route, we just practice civil disobedience and refuse to pay our taxes. Indira may have raised the tax rate to 90% plus, but it did not really matter, nobody actually bothered paying the taxes she demanded.

Very Very Good article
12/15/16, 11:49 AM - ANUPAM: The funniest story I heard during Demon was about a traffic cop in Haryana who took bribes on paytm. He had a hafta scheme where monthly payments would be made by some industries to him to relax an anti-truck rule on some road. He would contact the said industries and give them 5 or 10 paytm numbers where they could split the hafta into parts and deposit it. The same salami slicing was being applied. The difference is that Paytm accounts have lower KYC rules than banks. A working SIM is enough. Unless you do a raid on him, you were never going to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù his corruption. Whether he took bribes in cash or PayTM would not really change anything in spite of the ‚Äútraceability‚Äù of PayTM, he is just operating a few of millions of accounts, none of those actually in his name.

This story illustrates another side effect of the digital utopia that doing fraud or laundering digitally is actually better than doing fraud or laundering physically[7]. Digital fraud can be replicated en-mass and automated. As seen on twitter, Digital can increase anonymity when you want it to, In fact one person can become multiple people, online. When people figure this out a new set of entrepreneurs will spring up proving these services to others who need it. In my opinion, more than Demon, or NaMo advertising cashless payments, this will be the inflection point when digital payments takes off massively in India. If pornography caused the growth of internet. Laundering can be the killer app which pushes up digital payments.

If you are laughing at the last sentence, then you do not know the history of PayPal. I was fortunate enough to listen to a talk by Max Levchin who confessed that the ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù for Paypal turned out to be money laundering by the Russian Mafia. This use of Paypal by the Russian Mafia for money laundering almost killed the company through government regulations or worse. The tools that they developed to fight laundering became a part of the secretive CIA funded startup‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPalantir.¬†

12/15/16, 1:55 PM - ANUPAM: Security factor

Firstly, it is important to remember that your virtual address gets mapped to your device exclusively. Now couple this with the fact that for making any payment (peer to peer and peer to merchant), you need to enter your M-pin (a secure 6 digit pin set by you for the first time), and then you can see how it is a perfect closed loop.

Even if anybody gets hold of your device, they cannot do anything until or unless they have your M-pin. Similarly, for resetting your M-pin, you would need your debit card details (completely separate from your device information for security reasons)

No minimum amount. A single user can do 5 transactions totalling up to Rs. 1 Lac daily

Convenience factor

Taking all common scenarios, a total amount of Rs. 1 lac is good enough to cover all your daily needs be it online / offline. And again the number of transactions can easily be covered within the limit of 5 per person. Hence, yay to good lifestyle needs!

12/17/16, 9:30 AM - ANUPAM: And that is what we did to a reporter of the leftist propaganda blog¬†Scroll, whose entire reportage, especially those about the BJP or the RSS, is based on quoting anonymous sources.

This reporter is someone named Dhirendra K Jha, whose political acumen and understanding is reflected in his analysis of 2014 general elections. He wrote these articles, none of which quoted any identifiable person:

Caste politics neutralises Modi wave in Bihar, BJP in race for only 9 seats¬†‚Äì the¬†article¬†by Jha predicted 9 seats for entire BJP alliance in Bihar, BJP alliance won 31 out of 40 seatsHas the Modi wave run into a Maya tsunami in eastern UP?¬†‚Äì yes, the dude¬†saw¬†a Mayawati tsunami in Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati‚Äôs party couldn‚Äôt win a single seat of out 80 seats in the general elections.Simmering tensions between Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh dent Modi‚Äôs mission in UP¬†‚Äì the¬†article¬†quotes three BJP leaders ‚Äì all wanted to be anonymous ‚Äì and claims that Amit Shah was not getting support of local leaders and BJP could not do well in Uttar Pradesh.

Susu swamy..üòã
You might disagree with him but makes many interesting points..
12/17/16, 9:54 PM - ANUPAM: In Hindu philosophy, we don‚Äôt have a prophet. There is no one to command us. So, the most decentralised religion is Hinduism, natural for market economics. The only addition that Hinduism brings, which make us a more happy people than the Americans, is that we don‚Äôt believe in one-dimensional materialism. We believe that spiritual values are important. So we venerate people who sacrifice but are knowledgeable. This veneration of knowledge and sacrifice is what differentiates us from the Western model of market economy driven by¬†profit

1. Congress Raj gave all loans called NPAs today..
Every bank head was in cahoot with these politician.. Bribes taken and given

2. Loan write off is not equal to waiver. Mallyas loan while written off, his property worth 4000 crore has been attached.

3. Modi wanted to bring out white paper on NPAs in 2014..was  advised against it as it would affect market sentiment.

4. While Modi is not answerable for loans to mallya..He is definitely responsibly for Mallya running away under his watch.
12/18/16, 1:09 PM - ANUPAM: Similar arguments..
Government is corrupt, why should we pay taxes..

12/21/16, 7:50 AM - ANUPAM: Citing example, the statement said, if a trader makes his transactions in cash on a turnover of Rs 2 crore, then his income under the presumptive scheme will then be presumed to be Rs 16 lakhs at the rate of 8 per cent of turnover.
After availing of Rs 1.5 lakh of deduction under Section 80C, his total tax liability will be Rs 2,67,800.
However, if he shifts to 100 per cent digital transactions under the new announcement made, his profit will be presumed to be at Rs 12 lakh at the rate of 6 per cent of turnover, and after availing of Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C, his tax liability now will be only Rs 1,44,200.

He says, if the move was to end corruption then one could have undertaken more organic steps to curb that because there is no developing economy in the world where corruption is not a major issue.

According to him, it is tough to understand the current situation in India and the impact of demonetistiaon on the gross domestic product (GDP) at the current stage. He says, most business people that he has met in India are talking about a 30 percent impact due to demonetistaion and are downgrading earnings for FY17.

So, it would be tough tosee high earnings growth in FY18 too with so many economic disruptions, says Sharma.

12/22/16, 7:16 AM - ANUPAM: If industries do not follow these new guidelines, the government will cancel all concessions given to them. The amendments will be implemented once the law department gives its approval the second time. Karnataka labour minister Santosh Lad told TOI: "The amendment will give us the means to ensure that all private sector industries open their doors to us, to identify how many Kannadigas work in each company and rectify any discrepancies
12/22/16, 7:16 AM - ANUPAM: Sources in the labour department said the government did not want to hamper the "bread and butter" of the state GDP with the reservation policy . "We did not want to invite a problem with the powerful IT-BT lobby at this point in time. Let's first implement this reservation and then take on the IT-BT vertical later," a department official said.
The labour department has got the concurrence of Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah for the amendment, and the law department will vet the amendment once again before implementing it.

12/24/16, 8:16 AM - Pankaj Jha: When Lord Krishna returned home after the battle of Mahabharata, his wife Rukmani confronted him ‚ÄúHow could you be party to the killing of Guru Drona and Bheeshma, who were such righteous people and had a lifetime of righteousness behind them.‚Äù

Initially Lord Krishna avoided her questions but when she did not relent, he replied ‚ÄúNo doubt they had a lifetime of rightousness behind them but they both had committed one single sin that destroyed all their lifetime of righteousness‚Äù

Rukmani asked ‚ÄúAnd what was that sin?‚Äù

Lord Krishna replied ‚ÄúThey were both present in the court when a lady (Draupadi) was being disrobed and being elders they had the authority to stop it but they did not. This single crime is enough to destroy all righteousness of this world‚Äù

Rukmani asked ‚ÄúBut what about Karna?

He was known for his charity. No one went emptyhanded from his doorstep. Why did you have him killed?‚Äù

Lord Krishna said ‚ÄúNo doubt Karna was known for his charity. He never said ‚ÄòNo‚Äô to anyone who asked him for anything. But when Abhimanyu fell after successfully fighting an army of the greatest warriors and he lay dying, he asked for water from Karna who stood nearby. There was a puddle of clean water where Karna stood but not wanting to annoy his friend Duryodhan, Karna did not give water to a dying man. In doing so his charity of a lifetime was destroyed. Later in battle, it was the same puddle of water in which the wheel of his chariot got stuck and he was killed.‚Äù

Understand that your one act of injustice can destroy your whole life of honesty.

This story is great example of Karma Theory in Path To Prosperity. So Lets create any Karma with Awareness what is righteous. 

*Be Blessed Of Divine Light.*

12/24/16, 9:21 AM - ANUPAM: Merchants need to download the¬†Aadhaar¬†cashless merchant app on their smartphones connected to a biometric reader, which is currently available for Rs 2,000. The customer will then feed his or her Aadhar number into the app, select the bank through which the transaction will take place,and the biometric scan will work as a password for the transaction to be authenticated.
12/24/16, 9:22 AM - ANUPAM: Amazing. Good job.
12/24/16, 9:22 AM - ANUPAM: Almost 40 crore Aadhaar numbers already stand linked to bank accounts - that is half the adults in India. The aim is to link all Aadhaar numbers with bank accounts by March, 2017."

12/24/16, 9:29 AM - Pankaj Jha: Sir Adhaar Bill is as old as 2012
12/24/16, 9:29 AM - Pankaj Jha: Manmohan introduced it but cud not pass
12/24/16, 9:30 AM - Pankaj Jha: Jaitley Ji tweaked the bill and got it passed
12/24/16, 9:30 AM - ANUPAM: It is still not mandatory many supreme court orders
12/24/16, 9:30 AM - ANUPAM: Latest in August
12/24/16, 9:31 AM - ANUPAM: Yes passed as money bill
12/24/16, 9:31 AM - Pankaj Jha: It is being made mandatory through back door

12/24/16, 9:34 AM - ANUPAM: Let me say what is new here

1) previous plan for aadhaar enabled micro ATM..

2) This time they are focussing on specific android app compatible with android phone..which can detect  a biometric device costing 2000..

Every phone can be a POS device..once they make linking mandatory by march 2017
12/24/16, 9:34 AM - Pankaj Jha: Aadhar has a basic flaw it is not for citizen of India hence can't be made mandatory
12/24/16, 9:34 AM - Pankaj Jha: Citizenship Act 1956 would need to be modified
12/24/16, 9:34 AM - ANUPAM: Aadhaar was also a vajpayee govt idea
12/24/16, 9:34 AM - Pankaj Jha: For any such change
12/24/16, 9:35 AM - Pankaj Jha: No it's wrong I was personally involved in this
12/24/16, 9:35 AM - Pankaj Jha: Right from planning commission days
12/24/16, 9:35 AM - ANUPAM: Anyways that is not the point..

RTI was also vajpayee govt idea..

RTE,Land acquisition, Food security UPA
12/24/16, 9:36 AM - Pankaj Jha: It was all along an UPA idea
12/24/16, 9:36 AM - ANUPAM: Idea was there aadhaar was variant of it
12/24/16, 9:36 AM - Pankaj Jha: RTI was not Vajpayee Ji idea
12/24/16, 9:36 AM - Pankaj Jha: This is sheer lie
12/24/16, 9:39 AM - ANUPAM: Multipurpose National ID Card was vajpayee idea. Check up
12/24/16, 9:39 AM - ANUPAM: Check up Freedom of information act as well
12/24/16, 9:39 AM - ANUPAM: Vis a vis RTI
12/24/16, 9:40 AM - Pankaj Jha: Sir there something called NPR national Population Register Vajpayee wanted to give citizen card under it. Pilot happened 15k cards lying unprinted.It was promised by  Rajnath Ji in Parliament but again nothing moving will not move in this Govt tenure
12/24/16, 9:42 AM - ANUPAM: Because of logistic reasons, is how to identify citizens..

Hence they simplified it and went only for biometrics n basic info
12/24/16, 9:44 AM - ANUPAM: Aadhaar watered down version of national id cards..

Plan was similar to give benefits to people based on biometrics (aadhaar) vs giving benefit to people on biometrics + citizenry( national id cards)
12/24/16, 9:45 AM - ANUPAM: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act,_2005
12/24/16, 9:45 AM - ANUPAM: Right to¬†Information¬†(RTI) is an¬†Act¬†of the Parliament of¬†India¬†"to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to¬†information¬†for citizens" and replaces the erstwhile¬†Freedom¬†ofinformation Act, 2002.

12/24/16, 10:06 AM - Maaruti: Because still many female doctors have Doctor husbands who do the dirty job
12/24/16, 10:12 AM - ANUPAM: If there was a confounder, that would make this a correlation. So if we compared men and women doctors, but they‚Äôre either treating different types of patients or female doctors are treating healthier patients‚Äîthen this is not a causation. But we did account for this and other factors. ¬†Some people are saying this difference might be because of different training, but we account for medical school; some say it‚Äôs because females might be treating fewer patients, but we did account for that. So it is possible this is correlational, but the problem is nobody has come up with any plausible reason why this is not causal.
12/24/16, 10:13 AM - ANUPAM: Bullshittery in name of medical research..

12/24/16, 10:14 AM - Maaruti: Par what to say

In her 30's to 40's, they are like pears, still nice but hanging a bit.?
After 50, they are like onions'.?

Son--'Onions?'?'
Father---Yes, you see them and they make you cry.üò≠'?

This made his wife and daughter madüò°.

After his 50's, it is like a Christmas Tree.'?

The difference between Oo and oO...

Two young guys appear in court after being arrested for smoking dope.

The judge says, "You seem like nice young men, and I'd like to give you a second chance instead of jail time.  I want you to go out this weekend and try to convince others of the evils of drug use.  I'll see you back in court Monday."

On Monday, the judge asks the first guy, "How did you do over the weekend?"

"Well, your honor, I persuaded 17 people to give up drugs forever."

"Seventeen people? That's wonderful. How did you do it?"

"I used a diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this: Oo. 

Then I told them that the big circle is your brain before drugs and the small circle is your brain after drugs."

"That's admirable," says the judge. Then he turns to the second guy. "And how did you do?"

"Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs forever."

"Wow!" says the judge. "156 people! How did you manage to do that?"

"Well, I used a similar diagram," the guy says. "I drew two circles like this: oO.

Then I pointed to the little circle and said, 'This is your asshole before prison..‚Ä¶"

12/27/16, 10:05 PM - ANUPAM: Just strategy to distract from pain of notebandi..but a good side effect nonetheless
12/28/16, 7:30 AM - Maaruti: (◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ ◊ú◊û◊ò◊î)

The anti-Israel resolution that just passed in the UN Security Council is based on the argument that Israel is "altering the demographic composition" of Judea and Samaria.

The United Nations has consistently ignored the fact that Jews were ethnically cleansed from these territories in 1948, which is why there were no Jews in the area until after 1967.

Some context: In 1929, Arabs carried out a massacre in Hebron against the Jews who were living there, including women and children, while the British police stood by.

In 1948, during Israel's War of Independence, the Jewish residents of Gush Etzion were expelled and murdered. The Arab Legion from Jordan destroyed the Jewish villages of Kalya (near the Dead Sea) and Atarot (north of Jerusalem). The Arab Legion also ethnically cleansed the Jews who were living in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, and then blew up all of the synagogues there.

Not a single Jew remained in any of the territories conquered by the invading Arabs in 1948. The reaction of the United Nations to this reality? Silence.

Another important reminder: The terms of the British Mandate awarded national rights to the Jewish people ‚Äì and only the Jewish people ‚Äì in the Land of Israel. The Mandate, which expanded upon the Biblical and historical connection of the Jewish people to its land, was ratified in 1922 by the League of Nations. It was later adopted by the United Nations and until today it is a binding document under international law that defines the international legal status of the Land of Israel.

The United Nations has no legal justification for its decisions, only ignorance and malice.

After the match-fixing scam broke, he was the first to raise the issue of cricketers making huge disclosures under the amnesty scheme. While he did not name him today, he reiterated that it was a former Indian captain who had made disclosures running into crores of rupees.

``I have a lot of ammunition to expose a lot of wrongdoing in the I-T Department with me,'' threatens Gupta. ``Now that I have been suspended, I will make sure that others get exposed too. The battle has just begun.'' While on suspension, he will be entitled to receive half his salary from the Government, and should he assist the inquiry against him, he will receive 75 per cent of his salary three months later.

Gupta's suspension came days after he wrote a complaint to Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on the misuse of the VDIS, stating that the actual value of the assets declared may be five times the estimated Rs 30,000 crore. Gupta says he sent a copy of the complaint to Central Vigilance Commissioner N Vittal but was yet to receive a reply.

Get 5 essential insurance plans for just Rs 2,620 per month

By¬†Babar Zaidi,¬†ET Bureau¬†| Updated:¬†24 Oct, 2016, 1359 hrs IST

ÔøºET Wealth estimates that a 35-year-old needs to pay only Rs 2,620 a month to protect his family‚Äôs financial future from the uncertainties that life can throw at him.

A lot of people think that¬†insurance¬†is a waste of money. They contend that if the premium was invested in other avenues, it would grow to a sizeable amount. But life can take unexpected turns. The death of the sole breadwinner can transform the lifestyle of the family. A small accident can leave a person with a disability, impairing his livelihood. The treatment of a critical illness can drain the life savings of a family. Even 3-4 days in a hospital can leave a person with a bill equal to 10 years‚Äô medical insurance premium.¬†

What price are you willing to pay for peace of mind? For the feeling that even in the worst case scenario, your family will not have to face financial difficulties. ET Wealth estimates that a 35-year-old needs to pay only Rs 2,620 a month to protect his family‚Äôs financial future from the uncertainties that life can throw at him. That is the cost of five essential insurance policies that one needs.¬†

This week‚Äôs cover story looks at these five essential covers in detail. We explain why you need these covers and calculate the costs for different age groups and persons in various stages of life. All these policies are very cheap. As our calculations show, the daily cost for a 35-year-old comes to barely Rs 90, less than the price a latte in a coffee shop.¬†

The low costs is also the reason why agents don‚Äôt want to sell these policies. Ask any¬†life insuranceagent for a term plan and he will offer you an endowment policy instead. Try to purchase an accidental death and disability cover and you will be offered a rider along with a Ulip. Similarly, nobody will be interested in selling a home insurance plan unless you buy costly but needless add-on covers.¬†

Thankfully, you no longer depend on agents to sell you these policies. Most of these plans can be bought online. Buy these covers and you can sleep easy that most of the risks faced by your family in everyday life have been covered.¬†

How much do these covers cost?¬†

Life Cover¬†of Rs 1 crore cover for 35-year-old male for 25 years¬†
Monthly cost Rs 1,000¬†

Health cover¬†for family of four covered for Rs 5 lakh¬†
Monthly cost Rs 1,000¬†

Accident and disability cover¬†of Rs 25 lakh¬†
Monthly cost Rs 200¬†


Home and contents:¬†House covered for Rs 50 lakh; contents for Rs 10 lakh¬†
Monthly cost Rs 250¬†

Vehicle third-party cover¬†for 1000 cc car¬†
Monthly cost Rs 170¬†

Total monthly cost Rs 2,620¬†

WHY LIFE INSURANCE IS CRITICAL¬†
In case of a mishap, the money will support your family and achieve all your goals in your absence¬†

A life insurance policy is absolutely essential because it acts as a lynchpin of your financial planning. You may be doing all the right things‚Äî saving for retirement, investing for your child‚Äôs education and putting away money for other goals. But have you ever wondered how your family would achieve those goals if something untoward happens to you?¬†

A thumb rule says one needs an insurance cover of at least 6-8 times his monthly income. But this is a rudimentary calculation and does not take into account the liabilities of the person. The cover should be big enough to settle all outstanding loans, provide for big-ticket expenses as also generate an income for the living expenses of the family.¬†

Thankfully, one needs to spend roughly 1% of one‚Äôs annual income for a sufficient cover. Pure protection term plans give high cover at low price. A 30-year-old male will pay about Rs 10,000 a year for a cover of Rs 1 crore for 30 years. The daily cost of the cover works out to Rs 28, less than what you pay for parking your car in a metro.¬†

How much life cover do you need?¬†
Use the table below to calculate your insurance needs¬†

Ôøº

Which option suits you?¬†
Term plans are no longer the plain vanilla products they used to be till a few years ago. Insurance companies have crafted innovations that suit various customers and situations. Worried about inflation? You can buy a plan where the insurance cover increases every year. Won‚Äôt be able to spare money later? Buy a single premium policy that does not require you to pay for the entire term. Your nominee is not investment savvy? Insurance companies now have policies that don‚Äôt give a lump sum on death but stagger the payment over 10-15 years. Think that buying a pure term plan is a waste of money? There are plans that give back the entire premium you paid at the end of the term.¬†

Ôøº
In Pic: Gaurav Singh, 33, Kolkata¬†
Dependents:¬†Wife (33) and son (8)¬†
Annual income:¬†Rs 14 lakh¬†
Outstanding loans:¬†Rs 28 lakh¬†
Existing life cover:¬†Rs 17 lakh¬†
Recommended insurance cover:¬†Rs 1.25 crore¬†
Additional cover required:¬†Rs 1.08 crore¬†
Cost of additional insurance:¬†Rs 1,000 per month¬†

Not all of these innovations are good for customer. Increasing the cover to adjust for inflation is a good idea but you will pay a higher premium than a regular plan. Similarly, plans that return the premium are costlier and should be avoided. If adjusted for inflation, what you get back at the end of 20-25 years is peanuts. The staggered payment plan is also not a good idea. If the same amount was taken as lump sum and put in a bank fixed deposit, it would generate a higher income than what these plans offer. But these plans may be useful for families where the dependents are not very financially savvy and could be cheated by greedy relatives and unscrupulous advisers.¬†

Apart from the size of the cover and the payout structure, you should also be careful about the tenure of the policy. In their advertisements, insurance companies highlight premium rates for short-term plans. If someone buys a 20-year plan when he is 30, the premium will be very low but the plan will end when his insurance needs are very high. At that age, a new policy will cost him a bomb. He might even be denied the cover if his health is not good. Don‚Äôt take a 15-20 year plan that will terminate when you are in your 50s. Buy a cover till the age of at least 60-65 years.¬†

Ôøº

Not everybody needs to buy life insurance. If you are single and your parents or other relatives do not depend on your income, you don‚Äôt need to buy life insurance. No one will be financially impacted if you are not around. At the same time, if you intend to get married, it is a good idea to buy life insurance and lock in at a low premium when you are young and in good health.¬†

Reviewing your cover¬†
You also need to review your insurance cover at various stages of your life and when you take big-ticket loans (see box). If you have taken a home loan, be sure to take a term cover equal to that amount. In case of an unfortunate turn of events, your family will be rendered homeless if they are not able to service the EMI. However, don‚Äôt take a mortgaged linked insurance plan. It is better to take an independent term plan which will continue even after the loan has ended.¬†

The premium rates given in the table assume that the buyer carries the normal risk in terms of health, family medical history and occupation. If he suffers from any ailment that can potentially become life threatening or if there is a family history of a medical condition, the premium would be higher. If he smokes or chews gutkha, the premium will be roughly 25-30% higher than that of a nonsmoker.¬†

Ôøº

Don‚Äôt lie when buying¬†
Buyers should not try to hide these facts in the application. If the insurance company finds out that a policyholder concealed information that affected the risk to his life, out goes the claim. Most companies have medico-legal experts who scan the claim documents for any attempt to mislead. Every year, about 2% of the claims received by life insurance firms end up in the trash can. Your insurance policy is the bulwark of your financial plan. Don‚Äôt let it be rejected just to save a few hundred rupees in the premium.¬†

GUARD AGAINST MEDICAL COSTS¬†
Your family needs a comprehensive cover against hospitalisation expenses.¬†

The second most essential cover for you is a medical insurance policy. Some experts even say that medical insurance is more important than life insurance because the probability of a family member needing medical care is higher than the death of the breadwinner. Medical care costs are rising very fast and even a 3-4 day stay in a hospital can leave you with a bill of Rs 50,000-60,000. In comparison, the cost of medical insurance is only Rs 10,000-15,000 a year. If you take into account the tax benefits offered on medical insurance under Section 80D, the costs for those in the highest 30% tax bracket are much lower at Rs 7,000-10,500 per year.¬†

Avoid costly innovations¬†
When buying medical insurance, don‚Äôt fall for innovative plans that promise you plenty of advantages. Most of the time the exclusions are not explained to the buyer and he ends up paying extra for a benefit that won‚Äôt come to him. Even if you read the fine print, you will not be able to understand the legalese and jargon used by the company. This is why a plain vanilla indemnity policy, which allows cashless hospitalisation or reimburses the expenses incurred, is the best medical policy you can buy.¬†

Even if you want additional coverage, choose a policy that offers relevant benefits. A policy that offers maternity benefits will be of no use to a couple not planning to have children. A simple floater plan will be a much better option for them. If there is an elderly person in the family, it‚Äôs best to buy a separate insurance for him. This is because the premium of the floater plan is linked to the age of the oldest member and will bump up the overall cost of the insurance.¬†

Is group cover sufficient?¬†
Some people don‚Äôt buy¬†health insurance¬†because they are covered by the group cover from their employer. While group covers are helpful, they are usually not sufficient. There are a lot of exclusions and co-pay clauses. Besides, they are available only till you are an employee. When you change jobs, the medical cover also goes, leaving you vulnerable. This is why planners suggest that you buy medical insurance cover on your own.¬†

Delhi-based Balbir Kaur never considered buying health insurance on her own because she and her family were covered by her company‚Äôs group medical policy. But when she changed jobs in 2014, her new employer did not offer the same benefit. She bought a floater cover of Rs 3.5 lakh and pays a premium of Rs 6,500 a year. ‚ÄúThe medical insurance cover was essential because my husband is a self-employed professional and has no group cover,‚Äù she says. The cover has been enhanced to Rs 4.5 lakh due to no claims in the past two years.¬†

Ôøº
In Pic: Balbir Kaur, 37,¬†Delhi¬†
Health¬†insurance cover:¬†Rs 4.5 lakh¬†
Annual premium:¬†Rs 6,500¬†
Her husband is a businessman and her employer does not offer group medical cover. She has therefore bought a floater plan to cover the entire family.¬†

If you have group cover but want to enhance the cover, you can buy a top-up plan. Top-up plans are very cheap because they kick in only after expenses cross a certain threshold. If your group cover is for Rs 3 lakh, buy a Rs 2 lakh top-up plan with a Rs 2 lakh threshold. In case of hospitalisation, the initial expenses of Rs 2 lakh will be borne by your group cover. If expenses exceed Rs 2 lakh, the top-up plan will come into play.¬†

Cost of health insurance¬†
Buyers will need different types of covers at various stage of life.¬†

Ôøº

Do you need a critical illness cover?¬†
A simple medical insurance plan may not be able to pay for the treatment costs of critical illnesses.¬†

While a medical insurance plan reimburse normal hospitalization expenses, the cover may not be sufficient for some illnesses. The cost of treatment of certain critical illnesses such as heart ailments, cancers and liver diseases can be very high. For instance, a liver transplant can cost Rs 18 lakh. In many cases, the treatment can continue for years, draining the finances of the household.¬†

You can buy a separate cover against critical illnesses or take a rider along with a life or health insurance policy. Though riders are cheaper, they don‚Äôt offer as much cover as a standalone critical illness policy. The best part is that these standalone critical illness plans and riders pay out a lump sum when the disease is diagnosed, which can be very useful for a policyholder.¬†

It is best to go with a broad spectrum critical illness cover rather than choose one aimed at a particular disease. The cancer protection plans from some health and life insurance companies are priced lower than a critical illness plan, but will only cover one disease. Cancer is not the only ailment that threatens you. Lifestyle-related risks include heart ailments, diabetes, kidney and liverrelated illnesses. Hence, a wider coverage would be a wiser pick.¬†

Buy a dedicated plan only if you are a heavy smoker or are employed in certain high-risk sectors. But the premium for such people will also be considerably higher.¬†

How much does the treatment cost?¬†

ACCIDENT INSURANCE TO THE RESCUE¬†
Death or disability due to accident should not derail a family‚Äôs finances¬†

Life insurance covers you against death and medical insurance pays your hospital bills. But what if you are injured in an accident that disables you, either temporarily or permanently? Before you answer this question, here are some statistics. India is the accident capital of the world. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 4.52 lakh Indians died in accidents in 2014, with nearly 1.7 lakh of them dying in road accidents. The number of those injured in road accidents is at least three times bigger.¬†

This is why an accidental death and disability cover is third on our list of essential covers. The policy will pay your nominee a lump sum amount in case of death due to accident. In case you are disabled, the policy will pay out a lump sum amount. There is an additional cover that provides a monthly income if you are unable to resume work due to the disability.¬†

Ôøº
In Pic: Praful Ghildiyal, 28, Mumbai¬†
Annual income:¬†Rs 5.25 lakh¬†
Accidental insurance cover:¬†Rs 50 lakh¬†
Annual premium:¬†Rs 8,600 Apart from the death cover of 10 times his annual income, the plan offers a monthly pay for up to one year if disability stops him from working.¬†

Accidental insurance is very cheap¬†
Cost of insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh.¬†

Ôøº

PROTECT YOUR COSTLIEST ASSET¬†
Your house needs to be covered against calamities and its contents against theft and damage.¬†

You have insured your Rs 6 lakh car, the Rs 50,000 laptop and even the Rs 15,000 cellphone. Now spare a thought about the Rs 50 lakh house. Though home insurance covers what is possibly their costliest asset, very few Indians understand this and even fewer take steps to cover the risk. No more than 30-40 lakh households in India are insured against natural calamities and other disasters. This is despite the National Disaster Management Authority estimating that 60% of the Indian landmass is prone to quakes and 8% of the country is susceptible to cyclones.¬†

Then there are man-made calamities like fire, rioting and larceny. All these are covered by a comprehensive home insurance policy at an unbelievably low cost. The cost of insuring the structure against damage is as low as Rs 40 per Rs 1 lakh. Keep in mind that you don‚Äôt need to insure the house for the value of the property but only for the cost of reconstructing it. The costs can vary from Rs 1,800 per sq ft for a basic no-frills structure to Rs 3,000 per sq ft for a premium construction. So, a 1,000 sq ft house should be insured for Rs 18-30 lakh and the cost will be Rs 800-2,400 a year.¬†

Ôøº
In Pic: Shashank and Sonal Thakur, Mumbai¬†
Flat size:¬†1,035 sq ft¬†
Annual premium:¬†Rs 4,500¬†
What‚Äôs covered:¬†Structure and contents against fire and other perils, burglary and damage. Jewellery is covered against all risks and there is also a cover against damage due to terrorism.¬†

You can buy a fire and other perils policy as a standalone cover, but most insurance companies encourage buyers to go for a comprehensive plan that covers a wide range of risks. It‚Äôs advisable to enlarge the cover a bit.¬†

A fire or a flood may not damage the structure, but will ruin everything else inside the house. So you also need to insure the contents of the house against the damage. The cost of insuring contents worth Rs 10 lakh against natural and manmade calamities is just Rs 255 a year. Then come the covers against burglary and breakage. These are also important and will not cost too much. You can enhance the coverage if you perceive a risk, and if your pocket allows.¬†

Cost of home insurance¬†
The essential covers your home needs are very cheap.¬†

Ôøº

Five things your agent won‚Äôt tell you¬†
1. Compulsory Deductible¬†
Your policy will not compensate you fully. The first 5% of the sum assured or Rs 10,000 of every claim is not paid by the company.¬†
2. Limits on Claims¬†
Payment is subject to limits. Architect fees is limited to 3% of sum assured and debris clearance to 1%. Payments to architect or engineer for processing claim papers cannot be included in claim.¬†
3. Jewellery Cover¬†
Under a standard policy only up to Rs 10,000 worth of jewellery is covered. Cash not covered by policy. To cover jewellery, you have to take a separate all-risks policy that costs Rs 10 per Rs 1,000.¬†
4. Conditions Apply¬†
Your claim against burglary will not be valid if the house was not occupied for over 30 days at a stretch or if your household help was involved in the theft.¬†
5. Not Piecemeal¬†

The entire building has to be covered for earthquake risk. You cannot insure a certain section of the house in isolation.¬†

THE BIGGEST RISK ON THE ROAD¬†
Third-party liability cover protects you against claims by accident victims.¬†

Insuring your vehicle is important because in case of an accident, the insurance company picks up the bill for repairs. What few people know is that the insurance company also compensates victims of accidents in which the insured vehicle is involved. This compensation can run into several lakhs of rupees and has on occasions even touched the nine figure mark. In 2002, a court awarded Rs 12 crore to the family of an NRI doctor killed in an accident. Even if he sells everything he owns, the average Indian driver will not be able to pay such a huge amount.¬†

The good news is that this thirdparty liability insurance is mandatory for all vehicles and offers unlimited cover for injuries and death caused by the vehicle. Third-party premiums were hiked in April this year but are still low (see table). For Rs 2,000 a year, the owner of a midsized car is fully protected against claims by victims.¬†

Some owners avoid buying insurance when their vehicle is very old. This can be a costly mistake. Even if you don‚Äôt want to insure your old vehicle against theft or damage, don‚Äôt miss paying the third-party liability premium.¬†

Incidentally, general insurance companies have been lobbying for a cap on the liability for several years. They contend they are losing money on third-party insurance because the compensation is higher than the premium earned. They want that the insurance company should be liable to pay a maximum compensation of Rs 1 lakh in case of injuries and disability and Rs 10 lakh in case of death. If the owner wants a higher cover, he should pay a higher premium.¬†

Third-party premiums are up but remain very cheap¬†

12/29/16, 8:57 PM - Pankaj Jha: Chidambara Rahasya!!

Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram‚Äôs son Karti has built a huge empire for himself in different parts of the world worth millions and millions of Dollars. He owns large swathes of real estate, luxury resorts, football teams and other businesses in: 

London
Dubai
South Africa
Philippines
Thailand
Singapore
Malaysia
Sri Lanka
British Virgin Islands
France
USA
Switzerland
Greece 
and Spain. 

He also has accounts in the secretive Swiss bank UBS.
This has come to light from the documents recovered during the recent joint raids of the Enforcement Directorate and Investigation Wing of Income Tax in the Aircel-Maxis scam.

Chidambaram was Finance and Home minister in UPA government. Imagine a person responsible for managing the Nation's money and guarding the country engaging in this kind of LOOT!!!

One may have their differences and disappointments with Modi government but at least this LOOT has stopped. That itself is Achche Din for me!!

This IS NOT a rumour. This story was broken by the same reporter (J Gopikrishnan of Daily Pioneer newspaper) who single handedly exposed the 2G scam in 2009.
Just as in 2009, the mainstream media is not covering this because Chidambaram is well connected with the likes of Barkha Dutt/Rajdeep etc.

Here's the link to the newspaper report :

Option 4
Your default VPA is

Eg. 9999884512@upi
3. Add bank account by three first digits(eg SBI, ICI)

Now you can successfully transact by choosing 1 send option.
12/29/16, 9:55 PM - ANUPAM: UPI n USSD much more integrated now..meaning you can transact via normal phone only without internet.

Much better than paytm.

12/31/16, 8:34 AM - ANUPAM: How to use UPI without internet (for poor with feature phones, your rich friend who has iPhone but no UPI app as yet and for your android phone when you are out of data balance in village )

It has two steps¬†
A. Registration for USSD/UPI
B. Using it with shortcuts for ease of use

Pre- Requisites :¬†
Your phone number must be registered with bank
ATM card of ur bank keep nearby with last six digit and expiry details .( for SBI maestro card expiry date is not given it is 01/49 by default)

A) How to register for USSD and create UPI id¬†


Step 1 How to register
1.Dial *99# ( you will see USSD code running)..
It will show welcome to *99#

2. Select 1 for English or 2 for Hindi

3. Next option asks for registering your bank account

Run first three digits of your bank or first 4 digits of IFSC code to authenticate ( eg. SBI or SBIN for state bank of India and ICI or ICICI for ICICI )

At this point if your sim is registered it might disappear or ask for your ATM card details (last 6 digit plus expiry date ) to set up UPI PIN¬†
Eg (123456 04/20) . after this set up your secret 4 or 6 digit UPI PIN..

If your mobile number is not registered , it will show account not in list.¬†

P.s.
In iPhone options take some time to appear, wait push on reply once you have selected option.

Sometimes errors like external application down, IFSC not validated ,declined comes..
Sometime use 3 digit eg. SBI instead of IFSC code eg SBIN n vice versa..

Generally works in 2-4 attempts to be successful try within an hour or so.

OK now you have successfully registered !..you won't get a success message you would be asked for your ATM card details if successful .to set your UPI pin. You can set it now or later.


Now when you dial *99# you would get 7 options. You may chose accordingly.




B) Using shortcuts.


Post Registration here are common shortcuts



A) First look at ur profile details by dialling¬†
* 99*4*3#

It will show your UPI address
Default is mobilenumber@upi eg. 8586878450@upi
, ur linked bank account and if your UPI pin is set or not

common shortcuts

1)To send money to UPI address

Dial

* 99*1*2#

Put address

Then ur UPI pin


2) To send money to a person with no UPI address, only with bank account n IFSC..
.dial¬†
* 99*1*4#

3) To request from UPI id
 * 99*1*2#

4)To change your default bank account
* 99*4*1#

5) To request balance¬†
* 99*4*3#

6) To set your UPI pin( for first time or of you have forgotten)¬†

* 99*7*1#





7) To change your UPI pin 
    * 99*7*2#


Kindly share widely..
Teach those without internet to use UPI widely and for your iPhone friends who don't have UPI yet..
12/31/16, 9:48 AM - ANUPAM: In this chapter I will propose that effectively what people resent ‚Äìor should resent ‚Äìis the person at the top who has¬†no skin in the game, that is, because he doesn‚Äôt bear his allotted risk, is immune to the possibility of falling from his pedestal, exiting the income or wealth bracket, and getting to the soup kitchen. Again, on that account, the detractors of Donald Trump, when he was a candidate, failed to realize that, by advertising his episode of bankruptcy and his personal losses of close to a billion dollars, they removed the resentment (the second type of inequality) one may have towards him. There is something respectable in losing a billion dollars, provided it is your own money.

In addition, someone without skin in the game ‚Äìsay a corporate executive with upside and no financial downside (the type to speak clearly in meetings) ‚Äìis paid according to some metrics that do not necessarily reflect the health of the company; these (as we saw in Chapter x) he can manipulate, hide risks, get the bonus, then retire (or go to another company) and blame his successor for the subsequent results.

1/1/17, 1:05 PM - ANUPAM: The most painful arguments against GST and demonetisation have been a defence of informal employment. Employers who don‚Äôt pay minimum wages, Provident Fund, and ESI don‚Äôt deserve sympathy. How long do young Raju and Chhotu have to work in informal retail without an appointment letter or eight-hour workday? Are small enterprises only viable if we don‚Äôt enforce our laws? Isn‚Äôt informality the slavery of the 21st century? Isn‚Äôt universal enforcement of minimum wages only possible with electronic salary credit? India is poor not because Indians don‚Äôt work hard but because our informal enterprises don‚Äôt have the productivity to pay the wage premium.

Of our 6.3 crore enterprises, 2.4 crore don‚Äôt have an office or work from home, only 85 lakh have any tax registration, only 12 lakh pay the mandatory social security, and only 18,000 companies have a paid-up capital of more than Rs 10 crore. We don‚Äôt need so many enterprises; the US economy is seven times our size and only has 2.2 crore enterprises. No decent country has 84 per cent of its currency in high value notes, 85 per cent of its labour force working without a formal appointment letter, or 99 per cent of its enterprises with less than 10 employees. The notion that ‚ÄúIndian culture‚Äù is responsible for this informal employment is, at best, the soft bigotry of low expectations and at worst, racism. Informality is a child of regulatory cholesterol and the riskless view of informality.
1/1/17, 1:06 PM - ANUPAM: On my first trip to Patna this month a wise man said it has been Bihar‚Äôs misfortune that imaandaari (honesty) is equated with bewakoofi (stupidity). This isn‚Äôt a moral or spiritual insight; formal jobs are a rare ‚Äî if not extinct ‚Äî species in Bihar. The stories a society tells itself are unacknowledged legislation; India‚Äôs new story about formalisation, enforced laws, and lower costs of imaandaari will create new role models in business, politics and bureaucracy.¬†

1/1/17, 10:06 PM - ANUPAM: 9643979797

Go to twitter tag @paytmcare and @vijayshekhar with screenshot of your transaction
1/1/17, 10:13 PM - ANUPAM: My advice to people

Now UPI/USSD has become lot better.
Plus it comes under banking regulator with 70 years of experience. More likely that your transactions errors would be resolved.

Hence I pitch for UPI.
1/1/17, 10:15 PM - ANUPAM: I frequently get asked how to enable UPI for person with feature phone.(their default id ,if their mobile number is registered with bank is mobile number@upi)

I would also request all of you to download at least one UPI or BHIM app which had 2 million download in 2 days.
1/1/17, 10:19 PM - ANUPAM: My post regarding how to use UPI for poor people with Nokia phones or super rich with iPhone but no UPI app is here..kindly share widely.

http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spg8dq
1/1/17, 10:22 PM - ANUPAM: Using UPI without internet on all phones(windows,iOS,android,Nokia)


How to use UPI with/without internet (for poor with feature phones, your friend who has iPhone,windows but no UPI app as yet and for your android phone when you are out of data balance in village )

The core at back of it is new USSD interface which is now fully integrated with UPI.

It has two steps¬†
A. Registration for USSD/UPI
B. Using it with shortcuts for ease of use

Pre- Requisites :¬†
Your phone number must be registered with bank
ATM card of ur bank keep nearby with last six digit and expiry details .( for SBI maestro card expiry date is not given it is 01/49 by default)

A) How to register for USSD and create UPI id¬†


Step 1 How to register
1.Dial *99# ( you will see USSD code running)..
It will show welcome to *99#

2. Select 1 for English or 2 for Hindi

3. Next option asks for registering your bank account

Run first three digits of your bank or first 4 digits of IFSC code to authenticate ( eg. SBIN for state bank of India and ICI or ICICI for ICICI )

At this point if you are successful you will get this message . congratulations now you can receive money on this mobile number.
Your default id is mobile number@upi. Eg. 2426272829@upi.

Next step you should dial * 99# again , this time you would see 7 options. Select 7 for UPi pin.Then select 1 to set UPI PIN.( you can directly dial * 99*7*1# as well). Enter your ATM card details (last six digits n expiry code) with space. Eg. (123456 07/20)
Now you enter your 4 or 6 digit UPI PIn for transactions. You can successfully use it to transact. It is not your ATM card or OTP number. Write it down in a place as it is important.

Advantage of setting UPI pin by this method is that you don't require OTP as in BHIM app.

If it is successful ..you will get this message . congrats you have set UPI PIn and you can send money to Bank.

Next step is to confirm your details.

Dial *99# then 4 then 3 to show your profile details. It would show your name,linked account and if your UPI PIN is set or not.

Once it is done you can dial *99# successfully to send money(1),request money (2),check balance(3) , change your bank account (4 followed by 1) and use shortcuts as well.

Troubleshooting.

A) Many times you will get error 538,external appkication down, invalid option on dialling *99# . keep trying you will get through

B) sometimes on entering short name (3digit) or IFSC code(4 digit) you will get option transaction declined or account not in list,IFSC not validated
Try once again. If it still declines then may be your bank is not with UPI. Or your mobile number not registered for banking( different from SMS banking )

Give it 3-4 tries.¬†
If external application down dial 4-5 times before quitting.
In iPhone you have to click on reply option.¬†
Sometimes it will be stuck on waiting.
In feature phones reply by SMS option.


P.S.
For SBI maestro card try 01/49 as expiry¬†
Or add 5 years plus 5 months from expiry date.





B) Using shortcuts.


Post Registration here are common shortcuts



A) First look at ur profile details by dialling¬†
* 99*4*3#

It will show your UPI address
Default is mobilenumber@upi eg. 8586878450@upi
, ur linked bank account and if your UPI pin is set or not

common shortcuts

1)To send money to UPI address

Dial

* 99*1*2#

Put address

Then ur UPI pin


2) To send money to a person with no UPI address, only with bank account n IFSC..
.dial¬†
* 99*1*4#

3) To request from UPI id * 99*1*2#

4)To change your default bank account
* 99*4*1#

5) To request balance¬†
* 99*3#

6) To set your UPI pin( for first time or of you have forgotten)¬†

* 99*7*1#



7) To change your UPI pin
* 99*7*2#
1/1/17, 10:26 PM - ANUPAM: Now this is important because many of your vendors (vegetable seller,local shop owner) might have a feature phone only. But they mostly have a sim attached to bank.
You can help them register for UPI in 1 minute via simple *99# method so that at least they can receive money via UPI.And you can easily transfer them via UPI app. You just need to know their mobile number like paytm

1/5/17, 12:38 AM - Abhishek: Best friends graduated from medical school at the same time and decided that, in spite of two different specialties, they would open a practice together to share office space and personnel. Dr. Smith was the psychiatrist and Dr. Jones was the proctologist. They put up a sign reading: "Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones: Hysterias and Posteriors." 

The town council was livid and insisted they change it. So, the docs changed it to read: "Schizoids and Hemorrhoids." 

This was also not acceptable, so they again changed the sign. "Catatonics and High Colonics" - No go. 

Next, they tried "Manic Depressives and Anal Retentives" - thumbs down again. 
Then came "Minds and Behinds" - still no good. 

Another attempt resulted in "Lost Souls and Butt Holes" - unacceptable again!

So they tried "Analysis and Anal Cysts" - not a chance. "Nuts and Butts" - no way.

"Freaks and Cheeks" - still no good. "Loons and Moons" - forget it.

Almost at their wit's end, the docs finally came up with: "Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones - Specializing in Odds and Ends."

Everyone loved it.

1/11/17, 7:31 AM - Pankaj Jha: Michael Jordan was born in 1963, in the slums of Brooklyn, New York.

He had four  siblings and his father's earnings were not sufficient to provide for the whole family.

He grew up in a poor neighbourhood. Exposed to mindless violence and heavy discrimination in the slums, he saw for himself only a hopeless future.

His father saw in Michael, a lost soul and decided to do something.

He gave Michael, who was 13 years old, a piece of used clothing and asked: "What do you think the value of this outfit would be?"

Jordan replied,"Maybe one dollar."

His father asked, "Can you sell it for two dollars? If you can sell it, it would mean that you are a big help to your family."

Jordan nodded his head, "I'll try, but no guarantee that I'll be successful."

Jordan carefully washed the cloth clean. Because they didn't have an iron, to smoothen the cloth, he levelled it with a clothes brush on a flat board, then kept it in the sun to dry. The next day, he brought the clothes to a crowded underground station. After offering it for more than six hours. Jordan finally managed to sell it for $2. He took the two dollar bill and ran home.

After that, everyday he looked for used clothing, washed and ironed it, and sold it in the crowd.

More than ten days later, his father again gave him a piece of used clothing, "Can you think of a way you can sell this for 20 bucks?"

Aghast, Jordan said, "How is it possible? This outfit can only fetch two dollars at the most."

His father replied, "Why don't you try it first? There might be a way."

After breaking his head for a few hours, finally, Jordan got an idea.

He asked for cousin's helpto paint a picture of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse on the garment. Then he tried to sell it in the school where the children of the rich study.

Soon a housekeeper, who was there to pick his master, bought that outfit for his master. The master was a little boy of only 10 years. He loved it so much and he gave a five dollar tip. 25 dollars was a huge amount for Jordan, the equivalent of a month's salary of his father.

When he got home, his father gave him yet another piece of used clothing, "Are you able to resell it at a price of 200 dollars?" Jordan's eyes lit up.

This time, Jordan accepted the clothes without the slightest doubt. Two months later a popular movie actress from the movie "Charlie's Angels", Farah Fawcett came to New York for her Movie promos. After the press conference, Jordan made his way through the security forces to reach the side of Farah Fawcett and requested her autograph on the piece of clothing. When Fawcett saw this innocent child asking for her autograph, she gladly signed it.

Jordan was shouting very excitedly, "This is a jersey signed by Miss Farah Fawcett, the selling price is 200 dollars!" He auctioned off the clothes, to a businessman for a price of 1,200 dollars!

Upon returning home, his father broke into TEARS and said, "I am amazed that you did it My child! You're really great! "

That night, Jordan slept alongside his father. His father said, "Son, in your experience selling these three pieces of clothing, what did you learn about success?"

Jordan replied, "Where there's a will, there's a way."

His father nodded his head, then shook his head, "What you say is not entirely wrong! But that was not my intention. I just wanted to show you that a piece of used clothing which is worth only a dollar can also be increased in value, Then how about us - living & thinking humans? We may be darker and poorer, but what if we CAN increase our VALUE."

This thought enlightened young Jordan. Even a piece of used clothing could be made dignified, then why not me? There is absolutely no reason to underestimate myself.

From then on, Michael Jordan felt that his future would be beautiful and full of hope.

He went on to become the greatest basketball player of all times.

How can I increase my own value? I am finding it a very interesting thought.

1/11/17, 10:21 PM - ANUPAM: Pharmaceutical and biotech stocks plummeted Wednesday as President-elect Donald Trump criticized the industry and said he‚Äôd force them to bid for U.S. business to save the government billions of dollars.

‚ÄúThey are getting away with murder; pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding,‚Äù Trump said at a press conference in New York. ‚ÄúWe are going to start bidding, we are going to save billions of dollars.‚Äù

The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index lost 2.8 percent at 11:28 a.m. in New York, and the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index was down 1.6 percent.

Mumbai:¬†Over the next five days, the money in 160 million Paytm wallets will show up in a corresponding number of Paytm Payment Bank wallets as the wallet company becomes a payments bank.

As news of the change emerged, some social media chatter created panic amongst Paytm users who thought they would lose the amount in their accounts. Paytm has scotched these rumours.

What will happen to the money?

It will simply be transferred to Paytm Payments Bank Ltd on 15 January. This means existing wallets will move from One97 Communication Ltd (the company currently behind Paytm) to Paytm Payments Bank Ltd. This change does nothing to the money in the wallets. Nothing changes, notes the company. If a person has a balance of Rs2,000 in her current Paytm wallet, the same will reflect in her new Paytm Payments Bank wallet. Wallets that have been inactive for six months and have zero balance won‚Äôt be transferred to the Paytm Payments Bank wallet unless their holders specifically consent to the same while logging into the app, web or by e-mail.

This doesn‚Äôt mean people with a Paytm wallet need to open an account with the bank to continue to use the wallet. In a 6 December 2016 notification, Paytm said that as per Reserve Bank of India guidelines, its wallet would be transferred to the newly incorporated Paytm Payments Bank. ‚ÄúYour Paytm wallet will work as it is, even after 15 January. Log in details, wallet balance and user experience will remain the same. Your Paytm wallet experience will remain the same for all current use cases such as paying at stores, paying for Uber rides, ticketing, fuel, etc,‚Äù the company said on its website.

Nor does it mean people with a Paytm wallet will automatically get an account with the new bank. ‚ÄúOnce we launch the bank, you will be given an option to open a separate bank account with us,‚Äù Paytm said in the notification.

Anyone wishing to open an account will have to go through the mandatory know your customer (KYC) compliance that involves documentation such as Aadhaar and permanent account number (PAN). Only money in the bank account will earn interest, not that in the wallet.

Airtel Payments Bank, a competitor of Paytm Payments Bank, currently offers 7.25% per annum on savings accounts. Paytm has not yet announced interest rates on deposits. Paytm didn‚Äôt respond to repeated calls and messages and all information has been taken from public disclosures made by Paytm.

1/12/17, 10:29 AM - ANUPAM: A payment bank is fully digital and paperless banking and customers can access services over their mobile phones, including all feature/basic mobile phones. It offers all basic banking facilities like account-opening services and cash deposit & withdrawal facilities. Savings accounts are opened using Aadhaar based e-KYC. This requires no documents at all, only the customer‚Äôs Aadhaar number is needed. Although deposits upto Rs1 lakh can only be made.

Airtel Payments Bank offers all these services and just like any traditional bank, it also offers its customers interest on their deposits.

However, Airtel offers 7.25% interest compared to 3-4% offered by conventional banks. Besides the lucrative interest rate, the bank also offers personal accidental insurance of Rs1 lakh with every savings account and free talktime equaling the amount deposited in the payments bank-saving account.

In order to boost cashless transactions, Airtel Payments Bank plans to develop a nationwide merchant ecosystem of over 3 million partners that will include small kirana stores, small shops and restaurants etc. These merchant partners will accept digital payments for goods and services from Airtel Payments Bank customers over mobile phones. The payment bank will not charge any processing fee from merchants and this facility would be totally free for the customers as well as the merchants

1/19/17, 10:46 PM - Kashif: I pondered a lot about that list. And few question I have: 
1. is being a Brahmin above being a Hindu ?
2. Can Brahmin exist without Hindu , that is are they mutually exclusive
1/19/17, 10:46 PM - ANUPAM: He is being sarcastic

1/19/17, 10:49 PM - Maaruti2: Brahmin can exist without being Hindu
1/19/17, 10:49 PM - ANUPAM: Simple thing is this..
It is all about benefits..

If any party can give me unmonitored unchallengeable benefits ( quota) ..I will vote for that party instead of party that gives me Hindu/Indian identity
1/19/17, 10:50 PM - Maaruti2: I am
1/19/17, 10:50 PM - Maaruti2: I don't identify myself as Hindu

Hindu ka Kya karein..babaji ka thullu
1/19/17, 10:53 PM - ANUPAM: Mulayam yadav bolega non yadav ko.

1/19/17, 10:55 PM - Maaruti2: Jabardasti BJP Hinduwaadi party
1/19/17, 10:55 PM - ANUPAM: Important question is this .
Does having Hindu identity give you benefits by law.. Instead of being subgroup/caste..

There is only one minor benefit in taxes by Hindu united family..
But major disadvantages
1/19/17, 10:57 PM - ANUPAM: Hindu identity bas general category ko chutiya banane ki politics hai..
So glad that every "Hindu" group is trying to call this bullshit and trying to get quota for itself
1/19/17, 10:58 PM - ANUPAM: As we doctors know, if you are not organized..everyone out there is out there to scree you
1/19/17, 10:59 PM - ANUPAM: Screw

1/19/17, 11:00 PM - ANUPAM: If everyone was truly honest..they would have asked for monitored benefits. No one is.
1/19/17, 11:00 PM - ANUPAM: Tell that to Tamil Hindus..they would fuck you
1/19/17, 11:01 PM - Satish: #Problem arised is head get in love with 9 other heads and listen to head more than body..Raavan
1/19/17, 11:01 PM - Satish: Tamilan Girls üòúüòò
1/19/17, 11:02 PM - Satish: Correct..
1/19/17, 11:02 PM - ANUPAM: Brahmin is codeword / dog whistle for every wrong in Hindu society. Why should they katwao apna chutiya.

1/24/17, 7:34 AM - Pankaj Jha: *OLD CHINESE Wisdom*

A farmer in ancient China had a neighbour who was a hunter and who owned ferocious hunting dogs who were poorly trained. 

They jumped over the fence frequently and chased the farmer's lambs. 

The farmer asked his neighbour to keep his dogs in check, but this fell on deaf ears. 

One day the dogs again jumped the fence, attacked and severely injured several of the lambs. 

The farmer had had enough, went to town to consult a Judge who listened carefully to the story and said: "I could punish the hunter and instruct him to keep his dogs chained or lock them up. But you would lose a friend and gain an enemy. Which would you rather have, friend or foe for a neighbour?" 

The farmer replied that he preferred a friend. 

‚ÄúAlright, I will offer you a solution that keeps your lambs safe, and which will keep your a neighbour a friend." 

Having heard the Judge's solution, the farmer agreed. 

Once at home, the farmer immediately put the Judge's suggestions to the test. 

He took three of his best lambs and presented them to his neighbour's three small sons. The children were beside themselves with joy and began to play with the lambs. 

To protect his son's newly acquired playthings, the hunter built a strong kennel for his dogs. 

Since then, the dogs never again bothered the farmer's lambs. 

Out of gratitude for the farmer's generosity toward his sons, the hunter often shared the game he hunted with the farmer. 

The farmer reciprocated by sending the hunter the cheese he had made. 

Within a short time the neighbours became good friends. 

A saying in old China went something like this, 

‚ÄúOne can best win over and influence people with gestures of kindness and compassion.‚Äù 

A similar Western saying: 

‚ÄúOne catches more flies with honey than with vinegar."

Let us make a pact with ourselves to be polite when we speak and kind at every opportunity we get.

1. Fucking Law of Delivery Time - No matter how hard and fast you fuck, the child comes after 9 months.
Moral - Pressurizing does not alter delivery period.











2. Fucking Law of Direction - Even though both holes  are nearby, if by a wrong shot, you enter the wrong hole, no matter how hard you fuck, you never get a child.
Moral - Right direction is very important to get the results, even few centimeters away from right direction, even if it gives satisfaction, cannot lead to results.




3. Fucking Law of Human Resources - By appointing 4 men to fuck 1 woman, you cannot get 4 children, but if you appoint one man and 4 women, you can get 4 children.
Moral - Appoint the right person at the right position. Otherwise you would keep on wondering, why you are not getting the results even after appointing more men.         


forward to all Hard working employees.

An interesting fact I learnt today: 

On 15th Aug the flag is HOISTED (from below) and unfurled. Reflecting the very first day in 1947 when it was done so for the first time.

On 26th Jan, the flag is already up there and is unfurled. 

I was not aware of this

1/27/17, 11:57 AM - Pankaj Jha: *KOKILABAN HOSPITAL*


*Beware of Corporate Hospitals & Corporate Doctors.*

*Medical - Second  Opinion*

Corporate hospitals are paying a salary of *1¬Ω lakh* per month to their doctors.
But they have monthly targets.
the target condition for them to remain in job  is that, *they have to write tests & scans worth *3 lakhs* & *trap 25 patients* for surgery every month. 

This is not happening in *Charity Hospitals.* 

In many hospitals, unwanted surgeries & risky premature cataract surgeries are being carried out. One has to be fearful of corporate hospitals. 

If you show your medical card or if you say *"Doctor, don't bother about expense, please save the life"* to a corporate doctor, u r gone. 

*If they terrify u & do not give time to think*, u should become alert.

A genuine Dr. will talk encouragingly & don't terrify u. 

U can ask u r family doctor or a friendly doctor to visit the patient as a visitor & take a 2nd opinion before plunge into corporate hands and *that is NOT ALLOWED* at kokilaben hosptal.

Once you take someone to kokilaben hospital
*Within hour patient will be on ventilator /dialisis so one can not move patient.....INDEED VERY SMART TACTIC*

WHILE we had admitted our family member for almost 15 days we came across such cases n other few also adviced us to remove patient from there.

We shifted our patient to Hinduja hospital n were informed that  there was *no need for ventilator for patient n by doing so they have harmed patient n her system to fight back normally* 

They keep flashing *Every life matters*
Here *MATTERS* MEAN MONEY MAKING.



If u or ur family have been advised a surgery or a medical procedure & if u r confused about the medical options for u, then call at *70266 46022* or send ur medical reports at *medical@medisense.meor* visit *medisensehealth.com* They will get u a 2nd opinion from an expert doctors panel. It is a free service for patients.

This free service for patients is available in *21 cities in India* which includes *Udupi, Mangalore, Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyd* etc.


 *Please pass on to all u r loved ones.*

1/27/17, 12:01 PM - Pankaj Jha: Living Legend Treats Cancer With Ayurvedic Remedies

Popularly known as Vaidya Narayana Murthy, from a small village called Narasipura which is around 50 km from Shimoga, Karnataka, India, excels in helping thousands of patients ailing from different diseases, from kidney stones to heart diseases to different kinds of cancers.

Murthy,  a 60 years old farmer, carries the age-old tradition of Ayurvedic treatment with the help of some NGOs. Every Sundays and Thursdays people from various parts of Southern India start to queue up in front of his house early in the morning. With the help from his family and aides, Murthy serves his patients. On these days, he treats around 600 to 700 patients troubled by different diseases.

Murthy listens intently for a minute or two before disposing medicines for 15 to 30 days depending on the ailment, free of charge. The source of his medicines is primarily from different kinds of plants and herbs which he personally collects from forest during particulars days of the week (woody stems, roots, and barks). The patient needs to take these medicines with specific dietary instructions. Sometimes Murthy asks for certain lab reports if the patient has them. Narayana Murthy is the last ray of hope for many terminally ill patients suffering from cancer, heart diseases, and respiratory problems. It is not mandatory for the patient to come to collect the medicine as relatives or friends can also collect the medicine fortnightly or monthly with lab reports or signs and symptoms of the illness.
Murthy‚Äôs expertise in treating cancer, kidney stones, and heart block has left everyone astonished.  Just a day‚Äôs worth of prescription gives unbelievable results for heart blocks and kidney stones.

His treatment for certain kinds of cancer has yielded excellent results. These patients need to take 6-8 months of treatment, but certainly has been very effective.

It has been more than 25 years since Murthy started serving the people and he never expects anything in return or sought any attention or publicity.

In the age of globalization and the allopathic mode of treatment for every disease, somone taking up the task of helping thousands of people without any expectation is highly commendable. For diseases like cancer and coronary artery disease, the comman man cannot afford to have good treatment due to lack of healthcare insurance availability.

Murthy is no longer accepting phone calls but no prior appointment or any sort of contact is required to see him. Treatment is absolutely free and service is provided on first-come-first-serve basis starting early morning  from 7am every Sundays and Thursdays.

1/29/17, 12:09 PM - ANUPAM: It is wrong because it has been done retrospectively and by a single order.

I clearly remember when after 2001 to around 2004-5 , ppl just stopped getting visas..on subjective grounds..
And those with valid visas were questioned as well..

They can easily do that.
1/29/17, 12:11 PM - Maaruti: But why are we Indians hyperventilating about it
1/29/17, 12:11 PM - ANUPAM: Finally

Trump can't be accused of hypocrisy.. Unlike say modi, kejriwal who promised change too..

He has started acting almost immediately on his promises..

Whether his actions might favour/damage US is another matter
1/29/17, 12:12 PM - Maaruti: Denying Visa / accepting it or immigration it's all a countries choice
1/29/17, 12:12 PM - ANUPAM: Many parents of Indian american Muslims will be under intense scrutiny for visit etc..

1/29/17, 12:13 PM - Satish: Completely
1/29/17, 12:13 PM - ANUPAM: But it was retrospective n done with single order..
Am sure it will be enacted with due process within one two months.
1/29/17, 12:13 PM - Satish: Yes you can question process but intent
1/29/17, 12:14 PM - Satish: I believe it's for good of America
1/29/17, 12:14 PM - Maaruti: Intent ???
1/29/17, 12:14 PM - ANUPAM: Call him whatever..
But Trump is a businessman who means business..
1/29/17, 12:14 PM - Maaruti: You create refugees all over the world
1/29/17, 12:14 PM - Maaruti: Mess around in day to day affair or most of the countries

1/29/17, 12:16 PM - ANUPAM: America is a super haraami country. 
But even super haraami has to suffer consequences..

Single handedly with saudi arabia distributed arms to Taliban n syria
1/29/17, 12:16 PM - Maaruti: Yes
1/29/17, 12:16 PM - ANUPAM: For "strategic benefits "
1/29/17, 12:16 PM - Maaruti: It's said CIA is fighting Pentagon in Eastern Europe
1/29/17, 12:16 PM - Maaruti: What was the business of USA in Iraq and Kuwait ???
1/29/17, 12:17 PM - Maaruti: It saved Billions there by Bombing one whole country to rubble !!
1/29/17, 12:18 PM - ANUPAM: Saddam was USA's henchman against Iran and then he turned rogue, when money supply was stopped..
1/29/17, 12:18 PM - Maaruti: Where is covert operation ????
1/29/17, 12:19 PM - Maaruti: Why can't they kill Saddam in a Road Traffic or Plane Crash
1/29/17, 12:20 PM - ANUPAM: One of the aims of wars is ALWAYS economic takeover
1/29/17, 12:20 PM - ANUPAM: Done only when covert ops don't work
1/29/17, 12:20 PM - Maaruti: Then CIA is a defunct organization
1/29/17, 12:20 PM - Maaruti: Bloody leech good for nothing
1/29/17, 12:21 PM - Maaruti: That's why KGB ass fucked them so well
1/29/17, 12:21 PM - ANUPAM: Step 1. Control a despotic country by world bank loans and arms
Step 2 . covert ops
Step 3 Regime change
Step 4/ War
1/29/17, 12:22 PM - Maaruti: Yes and KG made it sure it became so much so expensive for them .
1/29/17, 12:23 PM - Maaruti: Anyways it's Funny to See Indians reaction on this issue
1/29/17, 12:23 PM - ANUPAM: Confessions of an Economic Hit Man https://g.co/kgs/5P4YN0

Very good book about a spy turned world bank consultant about how US used its economic hitmans to control Indonesia and saudi
1/29/17, 12:24 PM - ANUPAM: And how they use wars n regime changes in south America when loans don't work

1/29/17, 5:16 PM - ANUPAM: War was already lost when hiroshima was bombed..

Was done to try nuclear weapons in Field
1/29/17, 5:16 PM - Kashif: Absolutely
1/29/17, 5:17 PM - ANUPAM: America wages war many a times to just check out their latest weapons..

Their defence technology is 50 years ahead of the world.
1/29/17, 5:17 PM - Kashif: Also there is a factor of racism here . They tried it on oriental and not Caucasian (Germany and Italy) who were bigger threats
1/29/17, 5:19 PM - ANUPAM: Eg. 
They tried their drones in pakistan, iraq. N Afghanistan
and calibrated them perfectly

Even trauma medicine has gone revolutionary advance due to America's experiments in Field.

trauma medicine has

1/29/17, 5:32 PM - Kashif: On a different note, here is the hypocrisy in Bollywood . Actor whose fan claims he is nationalist and makes patriotic movie is not even Indian citizen
1/29/17, 5:32 PM - Kashif: In fact he is a Canadian citizen
1/29/17, 5:32 PM - Kashif: Given that india does not allow dual citizenship , he probably denounced or will have to denounce citizenship of one country
1/29/17, 5:34 PM - ANUPAM: Akshay kumar has only recently started making patriotic movies..

He will regret his Canadian move
1/29/17, 5:34 PM - Kashif: But he found a market
1/29/17, 5:34 PM - Maaruti: Since this news piece is of Indian Express there is 90% chance 'and they have lied '
1/29/17, 5:35 PM - ANUPAM: Well then akshay kumar should have clarified
1/29/17, 5:35 PM - Maaruti: Why ???
1/29/17, 5:35 PM - Maaruti: This FOE
1/29/17, 5:35 PM - Kashif: Haan haan Akshay Kumar is a patriotic Indian who makes patriotic movie. How come anyone say anything against him
1/29/17, 5:35 PM - ANUPAM: Because there is a grain of truth in it.
1/29/17, 5:36 PM - ANUPAM: Akshay kumar is Canadian.

Film stars are first to clarify at first controversy
1/29/17, 5:36 PM - ANUPAM: When they keep quiet then there is something.
1/29/17, 5:36 PM - Kashif: https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Akshay-Kumar-take-up-Canadian-citizenship
1/29/17, 5:37 PM - Kashif: This was his interview
1/29/17, 5:37 PM - ANUPAM: Foreigners are well accepted in india.
But akshay case is different. He gave up.
1/29/17, 5:37 PM - Kashif: Maruti you must be heart broken today after reading this news. My sympathy with you
1/29/17, 5:37 PM - ANUPAM: His ex priyanka chopra is on same path.
1/29/17, 5:38 PM - ANUPAM: For US citizenship.

Sonu nigam too.
1/29/17, 5:38 PM - ANUPAM: Katrina a british citizen.
1/29/17, 5:39 PM - Maaruti: I am so sorry Sir if you have such emotions about me , and sorry to disappoint you again . I don't have any such ' knowledge ' which is based on Quora and Scroll üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1/29/17, 5:39 PM - Maaruti: Katrina is British born
1/29/17, 5:40 PM - Maaruti: And I am superman and Salman ka Fan
1/29/17, 5:40 PM - Maaruti: So I don't even second time before I kill the black buck
1/29/17, 5:41 PM - Maaruti: Tarek Fateh is Canadian
1/29/17, 5:41 PM - Maaruti: So ??
1/29/17, 5:43 PM - ANUPAM: May be akshay kumar didn't know law before accepting Canadian citizenship or was trying to be super smart..
1/29/17, 5:44 PM - ANUPAM: He has produced a Canadian movie. Citizenship helps in getting tax benefits in Canada.
1/29/17, 5:44 PM - Maaruti: Sir yes
1/29/17, 5:45 PM - Maaruti: 'Break Away ' his movie with Camilla Belle and song ' Shera de Kaum Punjabi'
1/29/17, 5:45 PM - ANUPAM: Giving up citizenship is another matter.
Have no doubt he will renounce Canadian citizenship when forced.

He was already doing very well when he accepted it.
1/29/17, 5:46 PM - Maaruti: Any ways I am talking about Indian Express , and here IE have clarified
1/29/17, 5:46 PM - Maaruti: The piece of news is 8th April 2016 and reproduced in 5 Dec 2016
1/29/17, 5:47 PM - Maaruti: <Media omitted>
1/29/17, 5:48 PM - Kashif: No country offers citizenship to any individuals. One has to apply
1/29/17, 5:49 PM - Maaruti: I don't know why people have a simple understanding of the fact that As a Professional you can't mix your personal idiosyncrasies with Work

1/30/17, 7:03 AM - ANUPAM: One of the intellectually lazy, actually the word should be moronic but I am trying to be kind here, connections often made by our liberal media cognoscenti is between Trump and Modi, between the Republicans and the BJP, between the Right of India and the Right of the US, and if a poke in the eye as to the difference was ever needed, it was delivered by a succession of Trump‚Äôs executive orders. To put it in perspective, if Modi had come to power in 2014 and within a week, asked for the construction of a wall on the Bengal border, allocated more resources to search and weed out illegal Bangladeshi refugees already in India, threatened the government of West Bengal of withdrawal of federal aid if they continued to turn their back to influx of Bangladeshi refugees, put in place a number of policies that would essentially make legal Muslim migration an impossibility, and, then just for fun, asked for stringent laws across the country to ban cow slaughter, and asked Parliament for a plan to build the Ram Temple in 180 days, and made sex-determination of fetuses legal, and made Yogi Adityanath his number two man in government, then, yes, perhaps there would be a smidgen of similarity between the two.

Whatever you may have thought of Trump, one thing you have to accept. He does not waste much time. Within a week of coming to power, he has put in place, through executive orders, the foundation planks of some of the most extreme of his election promises. The hand of alt-right bannerman and the right ear of Donald Trump, Steve Bannon has never been clearer.¬†

2/3/17, 9:04 AM - Satish: What Indian advertisements have taught me.???

1. Kareena has dandruff problem, Katrina has dry hair problem,
Shilpa has hairfall problem

2. If you have a beautiful wife, make sure your neighbour doesn't use a deodorant in your absence.

3. Your complexion is more important than your qualifications.

4. If there is no salt in your kitchen you can use Toothpaste.

5. Every second oral care brand is No. 1 and recommended by every dentist in India!!!

6. If your daughter is not Ready to Get married, take her to a jewelry/textile shop.

7. Only reason why men use deodorant is to get girls.

8. Most Cola's cure all kinds of phobias. You will be close to a superman, if you drink these regularly!!

9. All superstars are so poor that they prefer to risk life for a cool drink than to purchase it for Rs:10

10. The special effects in shampoo ads are greater than special effects in Avatar.

11. Fruit content in shampoo and soap is more than fruit content in 99% of juices.

12. Amul has better satirical cartoonists than people who make better milk products.

13. Most people buy vehicles to travel in bad roads but complain about roads in India.

14. You can't eat Dairy Milk Silk without spreading it all over your face.

15. Nobody uses motorbikes for commuting, its only to pick up girls.

16. All soaps kill 99.9% of germs.

17. People believe that Bacardi makes music CD's and Directors special/Kingfisher make mineral water.

18. The only thing mothers and daughters talk to each other is usually about hair oil.

19. No matter what kind of expert one is, he'll always wear a white laboratory coat.

2/3/17, 2:23 PM - Chaurasia New: NO FIR AGAINST A ADVOCATE OR DOCTOR - SC

In an important decision Hon'ble Supreme Court of India said, that if the advise of a lawyer and Doctors goes wrong in some way, even than no case under section 420 IPC or something like that can be registered against him/her. Though Supreme Court also said that Lawyer and Doctors should take care of the interests of his/her clients.(Justice P. Sthasivam and Justice Ranjan Gogoi bench) 
Court also said that in professions like lawyers and doctors, the professionals cannot guarantee for the success of the case. Courts said that the advocate cannot provide guarantee to his/her client that he would definitely win the case and nor doctor can tell his patient that is operations are always successful. And though this professions doctor and lawyer can only say that they are experienced in their work and they would do their best efforts so that they are successful.

2/10/17, 8:04 AM - Pankaj Jha: Jiggs McDonald, NHL Hall of Fame broadcaster speaking in Ontario, says:
     
"I am truly perplexed that so many of my friends are against another mosque being built in Toronto. I think it should be the goal of every Canadian to be tolerant regardless of their religious beliefs. Thus the mosque should be allowed, in an effort to promote tolerance."
     
"That is why I also propose that two nightclubs be opened next door to the mosque; thereby promoting tolerance from within the mosque. We could call one of the clubs, which would be gay, "The Turban Cowboy," and the other, a topless bar, would be called "You Mecca Me Hot."
     
"Next door should be a butcher shop that specializes in pork, and adjacent to that an open-pit barbecue pork restaurant, called ‚ÄúIraq of Ribs."
     
‚ÄúAcross the street there could be a lingerie store called "Victoria Keeps Nothing Secret," with sexy mannequins in the window modeling the goods, and on the other side a liquor store called " Morehammered."
     
"All of this would encourage Muslims to demonstrate the tolerance they demand of us.‚Äù
     
Yes we should promote tolerance, and you can do your part by passing this on.  
And if you are not laughing or smiling at this point... it is past your bedtime

Ola union
2/14/17, 9:11 AM - ANUPAM: They reeled us in by promising earnings of more than 1 lakh per month and now because of falling fares, we do not even have the money to feed our families properly. We are demanding that we receive the fare sanctioned by the government which is Rs 21/km. First, they induced us to buy cars under their schemes now they are adding so many new cars that it has become difficult for us to pay off our monthly installments," says a senior member of the association, Kamal Rathore.¬†

The striking drivers are demanding better perks, relaxed hours and accident insurance (in the light of the recent death of two Uber drivers), however hike in share of earnings, discontinuation of ride-sharing services, and a stop on addition of new cars remain the top demands.¬†

"Ride-sharing has to be stopped. Out of 10 trips we get in a day, eight of them are on sharing basis. This drops our already weak earning to Rs 3/km. The companies can give as much discount as they want to the customers, but they should not make us suffer for it," says Rathore.¬†
2/14/17, 9:11 AM - ANUPAM: Akhand chutiye..

2/14/17, 9:22 AM - ANUPAM: ‚ÄúA driver needs roughly Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 daily to maintain his car and family. What they end up with is around Rs 1,500. The agitating drivers say they have been fooled by these companies, which promised them earnings of close to a lakh a month but they are earning just Rs 40,000 or less. These are the first signs of revolt. This will continue if they do not stop predatory pricing and make these cabs run at a loss,‚Äù said Siddhartha Pahwa, former CEO, Meru Cabs

2/14/17, 3:32 PM - vishalsatish: *Rujuta Diwekar* is the highest paid *dietician* in India. She is the one who took care of *junior Ambani* to lose 108 kgs. 
*Her advice to diabetics*:

1. *Eat fruits grown locally* ..... Banana, Grapes, Chikoo, Mangoes. All fruits have FRUCTOSE so it doesn't matter that you are eating a mango over an Apple. A Mango comes from Konkan and Apple from Kashmir. So Mango is more local to you. 

*Eat all the above fruits in DIABETES as the FRUCTOSE* will eventually manage your SUGAR

  2. Choose Seed oils than Veggie oils. Like choose ground nut, mustard, coconut & til. *Don't choose chakachak packing oils*, like olive,  rice bran etc 
*Go for kachchi ghani oils than refined oils* 

  3. Rujuta spends max time in her talks talking about GHEE and its benefits.
*Eat GHEE daily*. How much GHEE we should eat depends on food. Few foods need more GHEE then eat more and vice versa. Eat ample *GHEE. It REDUCES cholesterol*.

  4. *Include COCONUT.* Either scraped coconut over food like poha, khandvi or chutney with idli and dosa 
Coconut has *ZERO CHOLESTEROL* and it makes your WAIST SLIM 

  5. *Don't eat oats, cereals for breakfast*. They are packaged food and we don't need them.  Also they are tasteless and boring and our day shouldn't start with boring stuff. 
Breakfast should be poha, upma, idli, dosa, paratha 

  6. Farhaan Akhtar's New ad of biscuits - fibre in every bite... Even ghar ka kachara has fibre, likewise oats have fibre. Don't chose them for fibre. *Instead of oats, eat poha, upma, idli, dosa* 

  7. *No JUICES till you have teeth* in your mouth to chew veggies and fruits

  8. *SUGARCANE is the real DETOX* . Drink the juice fresh or eat the SUGARCANE 

  9. For pcos, thyroid - do strength training and weight training and avoid all packaged food 

10. *RICE - eat regular WHITE RICE. NO NEED of Brown rice.* Brown rice needs 5-6 whistles to cook and when it tires your pressure cooker, then why do you want to tire your tummy. 

A white rice is hand pounded simple rice 

*Rice* is not high is GI INDEX.  Rice has mediun GI index and by eating it with daal / dahi / kadhi we bring its GI index further down 
If we take _ghee over this daal chawal then the GI INDEX is brought further down._
*B.* Rice has some rich minerals and you can eat it even three times a day 

11. How much should we eat - *eat more if you are more hungry,* let your stomach be your guide and vice versa 

12. We can *eat rice and chapati together* or only rice if you wish. It depends on your hunger. *Eat RICE in ALL THREE MEALS without any fear.*

13. Food shouldn't make you scared like eating rice and ghee. *Food should make you FEEL GOOD* 

14. *NEVER* look at *CALORIES*. Look at *NUTRIENTS*

15. *No bread, biscuits, cakes, pizza, pasta* 

16. Ask yourself is this the food my Nani & Dadi ate?  If yes then eat without fear. 

17. Eat as per your season. *Eat pakoda, fafda, jalebi in monsoon*. Your hunger is as per season. Few seasons we need fried food so eat them. 

18. When not to have chai - tea - don't drink tea as the first thing in morning or when you are hungry. Rest you can have it 2-3 times a day and with sugar 

19. *NO GREEN tea please.* No green, yellow, purple, blue tea. 

20. Eat *ALL* of your *TRADITIONAL* foods. 

21. Strictly *NO* to packaged foods / drinks.

22. *Exercise / Walk* 
 to digest & stay healthy.

2/14/17, 8:47 PM - ANUPAM: the politically difficult step of corporatizing BSNL, and Panagariya writes that the prime minister personally intervened to push through this deep structural reform. The creation of BSNL wasn‚Äôt easy‚ÄîPanagariya writes that 400,000 department of telecommunications (DoT) employees went on a long strike to oppose it. Though the Vajpayee government conceded almost all their demands, there was no going back on the fundamental principle of separating policy formulation from service provision and the accompanying corporatization. Besides this step, the 1999 NTP separated the DoT‚Äôs regulatory and dispute settlement roles too, with the creation of the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal.

Before these reforms, the DoT was deciding policy for the sector, adjudicating disputes and providing telecom services. That such glaring conflicts of interest persisted for so many decades reflects on the calibre and intent of the governments that preceded the Vajpayee administration.

Under the 1999 NTP, the fixed licence fee payable upfront was lowered with the government introducing a revenue-sharing regime. The media was very hostile to the new policy.¬†Frontline¬†magazine ran a stinging critique of the policy, holding former prime minister Vajpayee guilty of ‚Äúa new standard of impropriety‚Äù.¬†Outlook¬†magazine said that Vajpayee‚Äôs moves ‚Äúhad all the trappings of a financial scam‚Äù.

On 15 August 2000, ‚Äúunlimited competition‚Äù was introduced in domestic long-distance telephony services. Just as importantly, import duties on mobile handsets were cut from 25% to 5% in the 2000 budget delivered by¬†Yashwant Sinha. On 1 April 2002,¬†Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd‚Äôs monopoly on international telephony ended. Panagariya documents all these changes painstakingly in his book, and it is these changes that deserve credit for the rapid increase in tele-density over the last decade.
2/14/17, 8:48 PM - ANUPAM: Pitroda, in fact, torpedoed attempts to bring mobile telephony to India in 1987, as Panagariya records. DoT had received World Bank funding to deploy a cellular network in Bombay (as the city was then called), with Sweden‚Äôs¬†Ericsson¬†winning the project. Panagariya writes that Pitroda, who was heading the Centre for Development of Telematics (CDoT), created at his behest by Indira Gandhi in August 1984, went to the media arguing that ‚Äúluxury car phones‚Äù were ‚Äúobscene‚Äù in a nation where ‚Äúpeople were starving‚Äù. Pitroda‚Äôs intervention escalated the issue to Rajiv Gandhi, who pulled the plug on what would have probably been India‚Äôs first cellular network deployment. Panagariya cites this case as an example of how turf wars within government arise in response to policy changes: because Pitroda felt that mobile telephony threatened his work at CDoT, he did not hesitate to use his influence to stop what may have been a better way to achieve the outcome of increasing tele-density.

As the data bears out, Pitroda‚Äôs strategy to grow tele-density through indigenous development in CDoT failed conclusively. Pitroda did not return to India till 2004, when the Congress party formed the Union government once again.

The results speak for themselves: Rajiv Gandhi and Pitroda‚Äôs model of promoting indigenous technology with the DoT trying to meet demand for telephones did not succeed, whereas the Vajpayee government‚Äôs policies curtailed the state‚Äôs role and created space for private entrepreneurs to deliver cheap and reliable telecom service speedily on a massive scale. The former tried to grow by state-led indigenization, the latter threw open the sector to competition and entrepreneurship.

Yet, the deceased prime minister‚Äôs son claims that the telecom revolution was his father‚Äôs achievement, and Pitroda feels no compunction in claiming to be the driving force behind India‚Äôs telecom revolution. In the echo chambers of 24 Akbar Road and 10 Janpath, fact, logic and even integrity seem to have no place.

2/14/17, 8:50 PM - ANUPAM: India‚Äôs telecom story is a shining testament to how policy clarity, political conviction for reforms and private entrepreneurship can deliver outcomes, within a decade, that government intervention and well-intentioned bureaucratic thinking cannot even conceive of.

The lesson from India‚Äôs telecom boom is that curtailing government control and public-sector clout in sectors such as agriculture, mining, defence, power, ports and banking can deliver similar outcomes‚Äîand no amount of spin doctoring by any individual or political party should be allowed to detract from this lesson.

Have nothing against anybody..

Rajeev gandhi n pitroda had individual zeal for computers. .
Promoted them when likes of vajpayee n vp singh were protesting against computers..but CDOT was too myopic n constricted telephony

Bhencho america hai ki assam
2/19/17, 9:30 PM - apurvaprakash: Simply outstanding thought!!! 

This message may change one's attitude !

Do read it  !!

1. Name the 5 wealthiest people in the world.

2. Name the last 5 winners of the  Miss  Universe.

3. Name the last 10 people who won the Nobel Prize for Physics. 

How did you do?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The point is, none of us remembers the headlines of yesterday !!

Even though these people must be the best in their fields !!

Applause dies !!

Awards are tarnished and 
achievements
are forgotten .....!!

Here's another quiz:

Let's see how this goes: 

1. Name 5 Teachers who added your journey through school.

2. Name 5 friends who helped you through  difficult times.

3. Name 5 people who taught you something worthwhile.

4. Name 5 people who make you feel special.

5. Name 5 People you enjoy spending time with.
.
.
.
. 
.
.

Easier.....right?üòä 

The people who make a difference in your life are NOT the ones with prestigeous awards and loads of money !!

Life is full of ordinary people who have made the world a better place for you !!

Cherish them !!

Hold Them Tight !!

Perhaps sometimes it's 'Special' to be 'Ordinary' !!!üëå

2/19/17, 10:20 PM - ANUPAM: If it was so serious offer janaushadhi stent
2/19/17, 10:21 PM - ANUPAM: A key feature of communism..everything is cheap and out of stock..
2/19/17, 10:22 PM - ANUPAM: And capitalism..everything is available n out of reach..case in point american healthcare..

Best healthcare in world inaccessible to many
2/19/17, 10:23 PM - ANUPAM: So already sarkaar has regulated private education, now private health care..now private jobs ..?..caste based reservation
2/19/17, 10:23 PM - Kashif: I would rather have it available and out of reach rather than cheap and not available
2/19/17, 10:24 PM - Kashif: Because out of reach is relative
2/19/17, 10:24 PM - Kashif: Whereas non a available is absolute
2/19/17, 10:24 PM - ANUPAM: True.
That is why capitalism despite being imperfect works better than communism. Always.

2/21/17, 11:46 AM - ANUPAM: Introduction of new Service Tax : 

Dear AWS Customer,

You may be aware of some recent amendments to Indian Tax legislation, which requires non-resident businesses, such as AWS, Inc. that provide "Online Information and Database Access or Retrieval Services" ("OIDAR"), to customers who are located in India, to register for and charge Service Tax at 14%, Swachh Bharat Cess at 0.5% and Krishi Kalyan Cess at 0.5% to customers not registered for Service Tax.

As such, if your account has an Indian billing address and you have declared your business address to be India, these taxes will be charged on your AWS invoice unless you provide us with your Service Tax registration number.

To ensure you are not charged Service Tax and the Cesses, please validate or insert your Service Tax registration number in your Tax settings page for your parent account and all linked accounts (choose Country "India"). Action must be taken prior to March 1, 2017 or these taxes will be included on your next invoice.

If you feel you have received this notification in error, please review your account settings and make the necessary updates.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact your AWS support center if you have any questions using this link:¬†https://aws.amazon.com/support.

Sincerely,
The Amazon Web Services Team

Very very important story.
2/24/17, 1:59 AM - ANUPAM: Makes the point, in  general you need stents only in patients having heart attacks. 
The point still holds.

2/24/17, 2:01 AM - ANUPAM: You led me astray with doxobid
2/24/17, 2:09 AM - ANUPAM: I will now detail, what happens in GB Pant, a leading tertiary hospitals. from my follow up with referrals there. 

1) generally patients having having heart attack are taken up for stenting..very good.
2) heart attack patients who are very sick are not taken up because it can worsen success rate of docs..very very bad..unethical

3) patients having angina /chest pain on exertion must have angiogram. While dates are given ONLY WHEN patient also has money for stents.
Now in stable angina, you don't need stents. And this practice is clearly unethical.

Now since 2 years, stents in GBPant a sarkaari hospital already cost around 30k, but still a lot of unethical/avoidable practice going on.
In private hospitals , this practice is even more common.

In india actually we undertreat patients. 

Always take a second/third opinion if somebody suggest you a serious diagnosis/surgery..preferably the opinion guy should be a 50 plus specialty head from a government hospital..with no conflict of interest.

2/24/17, 6:11 PM - ANUPAM: turn in wages, interest, profit or rent sufficient to buy that product. Somebody, somewhere, gets it all. And once it is gotten, there is spending up to the value of what is produced."

Say's law essentially states that the production of goods ensures that the workers and suppliers of these goods are paid enough for them to be able to buy all the other goods that are being produced. A pithier version of this law is, "Supply creates its own demand."

What does this mean in the context of robots destroying human jobs? If robots destroy too many human jobs, many people won't have a regular income. Without regular income, how will they buy all the products that robots are going to produce? And if they don't buy the products created by the robots, how are these companies driven by robots going to survive?

Gates offers a solution wherein he suggests greater taxes on companies that use robots. That money can then be used to retrain people and deploy them in areas where humans are still required. This will result in regular income to the people and thereby regular taxes, both direct and indirect, to the government. That is, the government can use the revenue from taxing robots to generate more revenue for itself. This suggestion is in echoes my views on government intervention and action in the scenario of robots taking over human activity.

But Gates‚Äô suggestion depends on several assumptions.

Firstly, it assumes that people who lose their jobs to robots will be trained for other professions. While this sounds simple enough, it clearly isn't.

Secondly, it expects the governments to do the right thing. That as we all know, is easier said than done.

Thirdly, it assumes that companies will willingly pay tax on their robots and not look for loopholes to avoid making these payments.

Having said that, Gates' suggestion still shows a way out of the economic mess that robots are likely to create.

But once we became free in 1947..jan sangh n ambedkar had clear views about loyalty to country..

2/24/17, 9:09 PM - Pankaj Jha: Two true stories that show how the examples we set today, may help shape the character of generations tomorrow...

It's important you read both.

STORY - I

We all know about Al Capone. The notorious gangster, mafia who virtually owned Chicago. He was a crime boss who lorded over the windy city dealing with all sort of crimes prostitution to murder to...you name it...and he escaped the law for many many years. 

It was because of one man ~ his lawyer nicknamed "Easy Eddie". Eddie was very good ! In fact, Eddie's skill at legal maneuvering kept Big Al out of jail for a long time.

To show his appreciation, Capone paid him very well. Not only was the money big, but Eddie got special dividends, as well. For instance, he and his family occupied a fenced-in mansion with live-in help and all of the conveniences of the day. 

The estate was so large that it filled an entire Chicago City block. Eddie did have one soft spot, however. He had a son that he loved dearly. And, despite his involvement with organized crime, Eddie tried to teach him right from wrong. Eddie wanted his son to be a better man than he was. 

Yet, with all his wealth and influence, there were two things he couldn't give his son ~ he couldn't pass on a Good Name or a Good Example.

One day, Easy Eddie reached a difficult decision. It's believed Easy Eddie wanted to rectify wrongs he had done. So he decided he would go to the authorities and tell the truth about Al "Scarface" Capone, clean up his tarnished name, and offer his son some semblance of integrity. 

To do this, he would have to testify against The Mob, and he knew that the cost would be great. Nevertheless, he testified.

Within the year, Easy Eddie's life ended in a blaze of gunfire on a lonely Chicago Street. But in his eyes, he had given his son the greatest gift he had to offer, at the greatest price he could ever pay. 

Police removed from his pockets a rosary, a religious symbol and medallion, and a poem clipped from a magazine.

The Poem read..."The clock of life is wound but once, and no man has the power to tell just when the hands will stop, at late or early hour. Now is the only time you own. Live, love, toil with a will. Place no faith in time. For the clock may soon be still."

STORY - II

World War II produced many heroes. One such man was Lieutenant Cdr Butch O'Hare. He was a fighter pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier Lexington in the South Pacific.

One day his entire squadron was sent on a mission. After he was airborne, he looked at his fuel gauge and realized that someone had forgotten to top off his fuel tank.

He would not have enough fuel to complete his mission and get back to his ship. His flight leader told him to return to the carrier. Reluctantly, he dropped out of formation and headed back to the fleet.

As he was returning to the mother ship, he saw something that turned his blood cold; a squadron of Japanese aircraft was speeding its way toward the American fleet. The American fighters were gone on a sortie, and the fleet was all but defenseless. He couldn't reach his squadron and bring them back in time to save the fleet. Nor could he warn the fleet of the approaching danger. 

There was only one thing to do, only thing he'd learned growing up. He must somehow divert them from the fleet. Laying aside all thoughts of personal safety, he dove into the formation of Japanese planes. Wing-mounted 50 caliber's blazed as he charged in, attacking one surprised enemy plane and then another. 

Butch wove in and out of the now broken formation and fired at as many planes as possible until all his ammunition was finally spent. Undaunted, he continued the assault. He dove at the planes, trying to clip a wing or tail in hopes of damaging as many B planes as possible, rendering them unfit to fly.

Finally, the exasperated Japanese squadron took off in another direction. Deeply relieved, Butch O'Hare and his tattered fighter limped back to the carrier. Upon arrival, he reported in and related the event surrounding his return. 

The film from the gun-camera mounted on his plane told the tale. It showed the extent of Butch's daring attempt to protect his fleet. He had, in fact, destroyed five enemy aircraft.

This took place on February 20, 1942, and for that action Butch became the Navy's first Ace of WW II, and the first Naval Aviator to win the Medal of Honor.

A year later Butch was killed in aerial combat at the age of 29. His home town would not allow the memory of this WW II hero to fade, and today, O'Hare Airport in Chicago is named in tribute to the courage of this great man.

So, the next time you find yourself at O'Hare International, give some thought to visiting Butch's memorial displaying his statue and his Medal of Honor. It's located between Terminals 1 and 2.

What do these two stories have to do with each other? 

Well, Butch O'Hare was... Easy Eddie's son

2/25/17, 12:36 AM - ANUPAM: Amit shah is much more in your face than modi..answers every question with straight bat..n that is why will never be PM
2/25/17, 12:36 AM - Satish: And I will agree he is not hypocrite
2/25/17, 12:37 AM - ANUPAM: He has razor sharp clarity on issues. Sharper than modi but arrogant n introvert.

4. Go illegally with protest anyway along with slogan shouting

6. Claim victim good under freedom of expression n sanghi thuggery

2/27/17, 8:12 AM - ANUPAM: Amartya Sen
The space for public reasoning is still considerable in India but it has shrunk compared to what it was earlier. There has been a number of new things that did not exist earlier, like charging people with sedition‚Äîessentially for having a view different from that of the government. That could be quite scary for people, especially if students are charged and arrested. This could have a stifling effect on public discussion. This is a new phenomenon, and so is branding people as anti-national.
2/27/17, 8:13 AM - ANUPAM: Lying from his teeth..
Largest number of sedition cases were filed under UPA
2/27/17, 8:14 AM - ANUPAM: That too by thousands..amazing..

Is there something called "Root Cause Analysis" ??

A Management lecturer was talking about "Quality".

Lecturer : We all know Lord Ram went to spend 14 years in forest and Sita was kidnapped because of a "quality issue". 

Student : How is this anything to do with quality? 

Lecturer : Tell me why did Sita go to forest with Ram ?

Student : Because she was his wife and respected his every decision. 

Lecturer : OK but why did Ram go to forest ?

Student : Because his father Dasharatha told him to do so and he never disobeyed his father. 

Lecturer : OK why did Dasharatha send his son to forest ?

Student : Dasharatha offered his wife (Kaikeyi) two boons , and she chose to make use of them in the future. 

And she wanted her son to be king, so on the day of Rama's crowning, 

she asked Dasharatha to send Rama to forest and crown her son; reminding him of his promised boons.

 

Lecturer : So why did Dasharatha offer his wife two boons ?

Student : Because during a military campaign against Sambarasura, the wheel of  Dasharatha's chariot broke and and kakiye inserted her finger to hold the wheel in place.  

Touched by her courage and timely service, Dasharatha offered her two boons.

Lecturer: Hence Proved. The quality of Chariot's wheel was not up to the mark .. leading to kidnapping of Sita...!!!! 

[So, using the "5 why" technique we see that Quality is very important and if the quality of Chariot's wheel was good, the Ramayana wouldn't have happened!]

2/28/17, 10:25 AM - Pankaj Jha: It is said in the texts that 80% of the fighting male population of the civilization was wiped out in the eighteen days Mahabharata war.

Sanjay, at the end of the war went to the spot where the greatest war took place; Kurukshetra.

He looked around and wondered if the war really happened, if the ground beneath him had soaked all that blood, if the great Pandavas and Krishna stood where he stood.

‚ÄúYou will never know the truth about that!‚Äù said an aging soft voice.

Sanjay turned around to find an Old man in saffron robes appearing out of a column of dust. 

‚ÄúI know you are here to find out about the Kurukshetra war, but *you cannot know about that war till you know what the real war is about*.‚Äù the Old man said enigmatically.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù 

*The Mahabharata is an Epic, a ballad, perhaps a reality, but definitely a philosophy*.

The Old man smiled luring Sanjay into more questions.

‚ÄúCan you tell me what the philosophy is then?‚Äù 
Sanjay requested.

Sure, began the Old man. 

*The Pandavas are nothing but your five senses*, 
sight, 
smell, 
taste, 
touch 
and sound..., 

and do you know what the *Kauravas* are?
 he asked narrowing his eyes. 

 *The Kauravas are the hundred vices that attack your senses everyday but you can fight them*... and do you know how?

Sanjay shook his head again.

‚ÄúWhen Krishna rides your chariot!‚Äù
 
The Old man smiled brighter and Sanjay gasped at that gem of insight.

*Krishna is your inner voice, your soul, your guiding light and if you let your life in his hands you have nothing to worry*.

Sanjay was stupefied but came around quickly with another question.

‚ÄúThen *why are Dronacharya and Bhishma fighting for the Kauravas, if they are vices*?‚Äù

The Old man nodded, sadder for the question. 

It just means that as you grow up, your perception of your elders change. *The elders who you thought were perfect in your growing up years are not all that perfect. They have faults. And one day you will have to decide if they are for your good or your bad.  Then you may also realize that you may have to fight them for the good. It is the hardest part of growing up and that is why the Geeta is important*.

Sanjay slumped down on the ground, not because he was tired but because he could understand and was struck by  the enormity of it all. 

 *What about Karna*? he whispered.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said the Old man. ‚ÄúYou have saved the best for last. *Karna is the brother to your senses, he is desire, he is a part of you but stands with the vices. He feels wronged and makes excuses for being with the vices as your desire does all the time.*

 *Does your desire not give you excuses to embrace vices*?‚Äù

Sanjay nodded silently. He looked at the ground, consumed with a million thoughts, trying to put everything together and then when he looked up the Old man was gone.... 
disappeared in the column of dust.........leaving behind the great philosophy of Life!

2/28/17, 9:00 PM - Abhishek: Doctor Tiwari had sex with one of his patients and felt guilty all day long. No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he just couldn't. The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. But every once in a while he'd hear an internal, reassuring voice in his head that said:
 
"Tiwari, don't worry about it. You aren't the first medical practitioner to sleep with one of their patients, and you won't be the last. And you're single. Just let it go, Tiwari."
 
But invariably another voice in his head would bring him back to reality, whispering:

"Piya Tose Naina Lage Re"
The Classic from Guide, 1965 written by Shailendra and Composed by Sachinda sung by Lata Mangeshkar
Picturised on evergreen Waheeda Rehman...but I didn't know that it was originally going to be in Devdas with Dilip Kumar & Suchitra Sen. There also was the same pair of Shailendra and Dada Burman.  It was pictured on versatile Suchitra Sen.  Wordings of the song were little different. Even music was little different. Whereas a tabla  piece replaced original sitar piece. Unfortunately the song was not used in the film and 10 years later it featured in Guide and went on to become a great hit...but see it ..how well it was picturised on the  great Suchitra Sen...a rare video ...dont miss ...

3/1/17, 8:11 AM - ANUPAM: One fall-out of the uncertain jobs situation has been the increased incidence of what are dubbed ‚Äúnon-standard forms of employment‚Äù, such as contract labour as well as part-time work. These place employees in a potentially vulnerable state, besides denying them legitimate benefits.

In such a scenario where jobs are scarce, social security in the form of unemployment benefits becomes the only way to maintain stability.

But as the example of Punjab shows us, having money without work can be a lethal cocktail.
3/1/17, 8:12 AM - ANUPAM: Why plot..?

Entire black money was shown as sales..hence increased consumption..simple..hence gdp rose

Thirty telugu techies were killed in US since 2008 due to crime. One indian person was actually pushed on rail track in hate crime. 
No media question. Obama didn't say a word.

Now at first techie shooting. Suddenly intolerance has increased.

I don't live in USA now. But sounds similar to church attacks in India.

We never want war with pakistan, it wastes our resources,money, people..

The rogue state with its terrorist always invades..
Kya karen invade karne de
3/1/17, 11:29 AM - ANUPAM: Best solution according to gurmehar kaur is when india merges with pakistan..

After surgical strikes..she spoke at a conference which suggested indian army is a war monger
3/1/17, 11:33 AM - ANUPAM: Bhai it requires immense creativity to assume  for a girl to stab a muslim lady in burka .many army personnel suffer from lack of equipment care post death..

But this is absolutely unbelievable
3/1/17, 11:34 AM - ANUPAM: At six years..amazing
3/1/17, 11:40 AM - ANUPAM: Her father was killed by pakistani terrorists ,when she was three..1999

She was filled with hate for all muslims at five or six, probably due to her father's death..2002

She wanted to stab a muslim female in burka at six..2003

Her mother told her that not pakistan, not muslim but war killed her dad..2003

She became anti war..2006

So much so that she doesn't want any retaliation of udi,pathankot n 26/11 n indirectly calls india a warmonger after 26/11 strike..2016 nov

Supports russian ambassador assassination by Islamist ..Dec 2016..

Don't respond to it by offering 20 year old,girl,martyr father..

Offer arguments
3/1/17, 11:49 AM - ANUPAM: Nahi to share mat karo..
3/1/17, 11:49 AM - Satish: Agree
3/1/17, 11:50 AM - Pankaj Jha: And this is true for public irrespective of their age age has nothing to do with stupidity very few people realise and accept how stupid they were at one point
3/1/17, 11:50 AM - ANUPAM: It is like entering a debate by making first statement like tujhe pata hai mera baap kaun hai

3/1/17, 11:51 AM - ANUPAM: We can have stupid views..but few people use victimhood in argument..
3/1/17, 11:52 AM - ANUPAM: You can have not claim to have independent views n then offer victimhood in same line..that is what makes it jar
3/1/17, 11:52 AM - Pankaj Jha: Those who manage to portray themselves as victims are True Political
3/1/17, 11:52 AM - ANUPAM: Yes..yes..yes..
3/1/17, 11:52 AM - Pankaj Jha: What's wrong in doing that
3/1/17, 11:53 AM - ANUPAM: So she shouldn't say that she is non political.
3/1/17, 11:53 AM - Pankaj Jha: Sometimes we persist to prove our point and this tendency is strong when u are young
3/1/17, 11:54 AM - ANUPAM: Agreed, but how many times have you offered this argument..you lost because your are from a group..
3/1/17, 11:54 AM - Pankaj Jha: It's only with age u learn how futile it was then to prove the point and most of the time it's not worth persistence
3/1/17, 11:55 AM - ANUPAM: Agree
3/1/17, 11:55 AM - Pankaj Jha: Want to hear stupid things just go to a Viva
3/1/17, 11:56 AM - Pankaj Jha: I really don't know why we are taking these comments seriously

3/2/17, 8:28 AM - ANUPAM: I know you have been called leftie or commie before , but how many times have you noticed  you or any  friends have been called antinational for taking anti modi stand.
3/2/17, 8:33 AM - ANUPAM: In My experience these are times when antinational is used..
1. Azaadi slogans n freedom of expression
2. Inability to chant Bhaarat maata ki jai/Vande maatram reluctance
3. Questioning pakistan related issues..

In an ideal society all of these should be up for question,
But i notice , the more deshbhakti is mocked..the stronger it gets...
English language media n left doesn't know what it is getting into..
Directly playing into sangh hands
3/2/17, 8:36 AM - ANUPAM: That is the difference BJP leaning  guys would not exhibit reluctance in saying hang them, a left leaning person in general ..you know yakub memon n afzal guru..
3/2/17, 8:42 AM - ANUPAM: While I am for absolute free speech ..in a non protected environment it would harm India's minority the most..

Suppose kal BJP starts creating front organization n starts discussing triple talaq n uniform civil code discussion n tarek fatah lectures everywhere by creating fronts in name of freedom of expression..
3/2/17, 8:44 AM - ANUPAM: In my knowledge they have already started playing such game , now watch out aligarh,hyderabad,kolkata..
3/2/17, 8:52 AM - Satish: Bhai ham se bada Deshbhakt poore India mein Nahi hai

3/2/17, 8:56 AM - ANUPAM: You know what again playing Into BJP hands, if you plan to embarrass them..
Being conservatives they have no qualms in saying hang them,lock them,bury them,shoot them..
It is liberals who seek exceptionalism in everything
3/2/17, 8:57 AM - ANUPAM: No death penalty,framed ,he has suffered etc etc
3/2/17, 8:58 AM - ANUPAM: BJP plays this game ten times better than left
3/2/17, 8:59 AM - ANUPAM: Next time antinational will be used for every crime by a minority opposition member
3/2/17, 9:06 AM - Satish: Every Crime
3/2/17, 9:06 AM - Satish: Is it small petty theft
3/2/17, 9:06 AM - Satish: Its child traficcking
3/2/17, 9:06 AM - Satish: Equivalent to Rape or more
3/2/17, 9:06 AM - Satish: Pom Pom Pom

3/2/17, 9:07 AM - Satish: Bhai i was making mockery and sarcasm
3/2/17, 9:08 AM - Satish: I am sayinh such bithces also claim deshbhakt in Todays era
3/2/17, 9:09 AM - ANUPAM: This mockery game is played the most n much better by BJP..

It is possible to be genuinely good army anti pakistan person n rapist at same time

3/2/17, 1:55 PM - ANUPAM: It is not even uniform civil code.
3/2/17, 2:00 PM - ANUPAM: Also appears that bjp is trying to create rift within muslims with triple talaq...

You will see lot many cancelled debates about triple talaq in coming days and all liberal parties will keep quiet
3/2/17, 2:01 PM - Satish: Actually BJP want to expose Muslims
3/2/17, 2:01 PM - Satish: More than Uniform Civil Code
3/2/17, 2:05 PM - ANUPAM: I think it sees it as strategy to get muslim female vote bank n create confusion there
3/2/17, 2:07 PM - ANUPAM: Somebody close to RSS told me this..that they are actively working on it..apart from govt position in supreme court. You will see many talks getting cancelled in muslim majority institutes.

3/2/17, 2:35 PM - ANUPAM: During the boom years, the Venezuelan government made some choices that add up to an economic time bomb.

Venezuela didn't save its oil money. It used it to subsidize goods and services for the people, but in some unusual ways. Another choice: instead of making stuff at home, Venezuela imported almost everything it could. The government also kept tight control on the exchange rate between Venezuelan bolivars and U.S. dollars.

As long as the price of oil was high, there weren't serious problems. Then oil prices came down.

3/4/17, 11:55 AM - Satish: After the war with Ravana and Rama, 

Hanumanji submitted his Travel Allowance Bill for his official tour for collecting Sanjeevani Booti to Ayodhya administration. 

The Auditor in Bill Section raised 3 objections : 

(1) Hanumanji did not take prior permission of the appropriate authority (Bharat), the King of Ayodhya, during the relevant time for his travel

(2) Hanumanji being Grade 2-officer was not entitled to air travel; 

(3) Hanumanji was asked to bring Sanjeevani Booti, just a single plant, but he carried a whole mountain (unauthorized excess baggage). 

The Auditor returned the bill. King Ram could do nothing except mark it down for re-examination. 

A worried Hanumanji approached the Auditor and offered a bribe of 20% of the T.A.Bill amount.

The Auditor now wrote on the Bill : 

Re-examined : 
1. Even during the relevant time, Ram was still the king through his Paduka.

2. Further in an emergency, non-entitled officers can be authorized ex-post facto to fly.

3. Also excess baggage is justified as bringing a wrong plant would have entailed multiple journeys with extra cost; hence bill may be paid.

Ram ji shocked !!üò≥
That's Accounts department

3/5/17, 3:16 PM - vishalsatish: #Intolerance, #AwardWapsi #Dadri  #Gurmeher, all these largely media run campaigns of outrage have had a clear pattern since 2014. 

1) An event is carefully picked and/or staged either just before or during a major election.

2) Someone, preferably a woman, plays an agent provocateur first, and then plays the victim claiming 'death threats and rape threats', but no one goes to the cops to register a complaint. 

3) 'Friendly' journalists from the left-liberal ecosystem step in, propping up the claims of the 'victim'. The victim is transferred from TV studio to studio, and encouraged to give a carefully curated version of his/her story, with liberal prompts by the 'journalists' interviewing them. 

4) Once enough 'hawa' is created, political parties opposed to the BJP take up the cause, almost always, AAP is the first one, followed by the Congress. 

5) Any voices politely questioning the narrative, no matter how credible or accomplished they are, are immediately termed 'abusive, hateful, intolerant' and massively trolled.   

6) In an amazing coincidence, the carefully orchestrated campaign reaches its crescendo around the last phase of the election campaign. 

7) Once the polling is over, the campaign is quietly withdrawn, sleeper cells are told to sleep again, till it is time to activate them during the next round of elections!

3/11/17, 7:37 PM - Satish: Dear friends and family,

After demonization, in November the future of UP is looking bright and secure with BJP focusing on the key issues. 

There is no better time to focus on real estate than now. The market which will speed up. 
If you have invested in Greater Noida/ Noida or are planning to invest in Greater Noida/ Noida, you're to be in high benefit.

The time has come for real estate to be strong and stable with this developing nation. The BJP might be building an international airport, a better metro and developing Noida.

Let us be united together for the better government by focusing on becoming better citizens and developing ourselves along with our state.

Warm regards,

3/13/17, 5:10 PM - ANUPAM: Day 21- I am abruptly called by Arunabh at 6.45 PM. I am in the local back towards my home. He demands I come back to office. Apparently i have not finished some part of my work. I reluctantly come back. There are 3 people in office. 2 of them leave withing 5 minutes of me coming in. And Arunabh is sitting on a Chair in a casual manner. I walk up to him. He looks at me and asks me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äú Chaturbhuj Sthan ka naam suni ho‚Äù? I am stunned. For Non Starters, Chaturbhuj Sthan is the Red Light District of Muzaffarpur. I didnt respond. His second question- ‚ÄúHumko Chaturbhuj Sthan Bahut Pasand Hai. Udhar commercial deals hoti hain. Tum Bhi to commercial deal pe aayi ho‚Äù. I was getting where he was leading the discussion to. I avoided an interaction. I said ‚ÄúArunabh, aap bade bhai hain. Meri tabiyat thodi theek nahi hai. Kya karna hai bataiye. Hum karke ghar jaayenge‚Äù He suddenly holds my hand. Says ‚ÄúMadam, thoda role play karein‚Äù. I was stunned. None of this was something i had ever asked for. I ran away. Locked myself in the toilet. And cried. He went away. But i was thinking why the hell he is after me? What did i do to make this happen to me. That was the longest night of my life.

3/15/17, 7:02 AM - Pankaj Jha: Modi destroying termite ridden old Banyan tree

*Mark Tully on Modi*

Mark Tully the BBC correspondent for India for many decades writes about changes happening in MODI'S regime.
In his Book "No Full Stops in India," while discussing about change writes -
In India change takes a lot more time.The birth will be slow and perhaps painful. I believe it could be the *birth of a new order* which is not held up by the crumbling colonial pillars left behind by the Raj but is *GENUINELY Indian* ; a GC modern order, but *not a slavish imitation* of other modern orders‚Äù.
He goes on to say that ‚Äì ‚ÄúFor all its great achievements, the *Nehru dynasty* has stood like a Banyan tree, overshadowing the people and the institutions of India, and all Indians know that nothing grows under the Banyan tree‚Äù.
As Mark said , Change will be slow and painful, therefore for someone who doesn‚Äôt read and makes judgement based on perception will for quite some time not be able to see the change taking place or will pretend as if nothing is changing.
The way changes are coming in *Railways, Power sector, Defense Production and in governance* and at the same time accompanied by the *resentment of the old forces* indicate that the process of change has begun albeit slowly but firmly and is going to be painful.
Let us not undermine the capabilities of this termite ridden old Banyan tree which will still try its best to stop any one growing to the extent that it may even turn the soil upside down before falling down.
For a year or so we may witness more of Dadris, more of Kaniyahas, more of Owaisi style shouting but finally if the *Society keeps its cool, acts maturely* and continues to perform we will sail through and the old forces will die a natural death.
LET ME ADD to this - every day the new stir media throws in your face is all doctored by *forces who wish to topple Modi Govt as Modi has uprooted them* and they are like fish out of the water.
 The time has come to continue to support the man and keep your faith intact and we will see new India for sure - bigger, better, stronger, corruption free , peaceful , prosperous than ever before with people having better quality of life..

*- Mark Tully*.

3/19/17, 11:21 AM - Satish: Worth a read: The story of watermelons by Manohar Parrikar:

"I am from the village of Parra in Goa, hence we are called Parrikars. My village is famous for its watermelons. When I was a child, the farmers would organise a watermelon-eating contest at the end of the harvest season in May. 

All the kids would be invited to eat as many watermelons as they wanted. Years later, I went to IIT Mumbai to study engineering. I went back to my village after 6.5 years. 

I went to the market looking for watermelons. They were all gone. The ones that were there were so small.

 I went to see the farmer who hosted the watermelon-eating contest. His son had taken over. He would host the contest but there was a difference. 

When the older farmer gave us watermelons to eat he would ask us to spit out the seeds into a bowl. We were told not to bite into the seeds.

 He was collecting the seeds for his next crop. We were unpaid child labourers, actually. He kept his best watermelons for the contest and he got the best seeds which would yield even bigger watermelons the next year. 

His son, when he took over, realised that the larger watermelons would fetch more money in the market so he sold the larger ones and kept the smaller ones for the contest. 

The next year, the watermelons were smaller, the year later even small. In watermelons the generation is one year. In seven years, Parra's best watermelons were finished. In humans, generations change after 25 years. It will take us 200 years to figure what we were doing wrong while educating our children."

Unless we employ our best to train the next generation, this is what can happen to us. We must attract the best into teaching profession.

Great story indeed! Each one of us are responsible to offer our best culture to next generation! 

The whole world is looking to India as a Spiritual Leader. 

Unfortunately, hardly few are aware of the great heritage we have carried! 

If we don't pass on right things to next generation, they will be misguided.

3/19/17, 11:49 AM - ANUPAM: This is how many corporate hospitals work currently :

One leader of team is hired he assembles his own team ..

Now this is what he does,
Takes 50% of share of profits n keeps junior dm,mch on fixed salary regardless of income

No minimal guarantee
At the end of month, they calculate our salary
3/19/17, 11:53 AM - ANUPAM: The point is this, what about subordinates in your team.
3/19/17, 11:59 AM - ANUPAM: It is my view, above a basic guaranteed minimum salary, profits n losses must be both must be borne by all employees in pre-defined proportion ..

Currently the most senior guy picks up most profits n exploits his juniors.
3/19/17, 11:59 AM - ANUPAM: And absolutely no transparency..
3/19/17, 12:02 PM - ANUPAM: In most so called private hospitals, there is no I repeat  absolutely transparency ..of salary structure..n sharing of profits

They are corporate only in name..

That is why first thing a junior does is run off to another hospital to become a senior as soon as he gets a chance..

More so in surgical departments.
3/19/17, 12:03 PM - Abhishek: Bhai
Main hi puri team hun

3/22/17, 10:05 AM - ANUPAM: https://realitycheck.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/is-the-right-to-education-quota-really-for-the-poor/

Summary : RTE was introduced as quota for poor in private schools.It is not. It is effectively 20% caste based quota, with only 4-5% for economic criteria. It does not apply to minority schools which are leaders in field of education. 
So, if your child is studying in a private school whose owner is a non-minority. You are effectively cross subsidizing the fees of other 25%, who might not be most needy. Next time you wonder, why your school fees are rising so much think over this.

Also notable is the point , that whether you are mentally ready for caste based quota in private sector, if you are not then be prepared..RTE is the perfect template on which these will be introduced in private sector.
3/22/17, 10:06 AM - ANUPAM: My mind says..

The next challenge to hindu consolidation will come from private sector quota..

Nitish n rahul gandhi have already endorsed it.

One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. 
After the cut, he asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money from you, I'm doing community service this week.

The florist was pleased and left the shop. 

When the barber went to open his shop the next morning, there was a 'Thank You' card and a dozen roses waiting for him at his door. 

Later, a grocer comes in for a haircut, and when he tried to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you , I'm doing community service this week.

The grocer was happy and left the shop. 

The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a 'Thank You' card and a bag of fresh vegetables waiting for him at his door.

Then a politician came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you. I'm doing community service this week.

The politician was very happy and left the shop. 

The next morning, when the barber went to open up, 
there were a dozen politicians lined up waiting for a free haircut. 

And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between the citizens of our country and the politicians who run it. 

If you don't forward this, someone will miss a good laugh.

3/23/17, 5:32 PM - ANUPAM: Connecting modi to everything.
3/23/17, 6:05 PM - Satish: Wah he takes credit of everything...and blame on whom????
3/23/17, 6:05 PM - Satish: Court???
3/23/17, 6:06 PM - ANUPAM: Aha..thoda aur..

Every month doctor assaulted in delhi. Never heard you blaming it on shiela dixit or kejriwal..

Is baar kya special tha
3/23/17, 6:08 PM - ANUPAM: Remember kanpur..

Police entered hostels beat up students n singled out.
3/23/17, 6:09 PM - ANUPAM: Systematic Problems never go up by making laws. Health and and education n law n order are state subjects.
3/23/17, 6:11 PM - ANUPAM: Lastly it seems nice in echo chambers but most public has no sympathy for any govt employee including doctors regardless of how hard they work.

3/23/17, 6:27 PM - ANUPAM: Why do you think while most government department are inefficient, but it is doctors only who are mostly abused,beaten
3/23/17, 6:27 PM - Satish: Industrialists no one can touch for obvious reasons...impact on economy...impact on chanda...impact on...
3/23/17, 6:28 PM - Satish: Easy target...give emotional spin...mere isko maara
3/23/17, 6:30 PM - ANUPAM: So they can never be given full protection, in any case private guards earning 10k can't be ur protection..
Obviously we must ask fir better laws n it's reinforcement but that's utopia.
Much better is prevention by teaching doctor manipulation n dousing fire like chanakya niti
3/23/17, 6:31 PM - ANUPAM: Every one knows a sick patient needs more than 10 mins..still govt can't invest much..so it is clear doc protect themselves either by ganging up or lying through teeth.

3/23/17, 11:44 PM - ANUPAM: You must remember, how traditional vote banks where formed post mandal, rise of OBC..
Now since bjp led by obc game has changed
3/23/17, 11:46 PM - ANUPAM: Next battle will be fought over quota in private sector, otherwise difficult to challenge modi n shah unless major blunder .

MLAG  is  starting  a  REGISTRY  of  incidents  of  violence  against doctors / hospitals / medical staff  as  have  occurred  across  the  country. Tomorrow  for  any  legal  or  legislative action  we  need  authentic , collated  data  which  is  as  yet  anecdotal and  not  comprehensive.

I  request everyone  to  cooperate  and  report  all cases  of  violence  to  us  at  mlagindemnity@gmail.com or  medicoslegalactiongroup2@gmail.com . We  need the  following  information;

1)    Date  of  violence
2)    Patient name
3)    Hospital name
4)    Name of Doctors  assaulted
5)    Injury  sustained; Simple/serious/grievous/death
6)    FIR  lodged for violence or not
7)    url  / source  of  information

We  will  display  this  registry  at  our  website www.mlag.in  and  any  correction or  updates  may  be  intimated to  us. The  information  will  be  easily  available  and  open  to  use  by  everyone  including IMA  and  activists. Kindly cooperate  and  help  us  generate  this  data  for  overall  benefit  of  the  community.

3/25/17, 9:21 PM - ANUPAM: When I was young , I used to read a lot of fiction n non fiction..a lot interested in laws of power n communication n negotiation just as hobby..

Then when I analysed satish, he had unconsciously , I guess most of qualities of master negotiator n mafiosi..

Sadly, his current job in knowledge sector uses none of these skills..has become quite domesticated.
3/25/17, 9:21 PM - pratyush final: Bhai..satish pe allegation mat lagao

3/25/17, 9:24 PM - ANUPAM: I was flabbergasted when on a trip to meet his then girlfriend, he made two phone calls to two different girls ..n used exactly same dialogues on them..n possibly on his then girlfriend too..

I was shocked..asked him..why do you do this..

He said I love to make girls swoon..
That moment I realised he was more in love with love-games than with any of girls.
3/25/17, 9:25 PM - ANUPAM: Satish ..love games
Vishal,kashif lust games

3/25/17, 9:36 PM - ANUPAM: Physical pleasure doesn't hurt. Ask kashif n vishal..
You always left the game when 90% won..phat jaati thi kya. üòã

Finally something for the doctors...

Dr Ramesh Ganesan asked a medico legal question
21 hours ago - 

DO NOT  IGNORE. 

"DOCTORS VS JUDGES":

 Judiciary should also come under CPA (Consumer Protection Act).

"Every body must READ and SHARE this article.      

--In the Salman Khan hit and run case the LOWER court judge and the HIGH court judge had the SAME pieces of EVIDENCE to deal with.

--They also had the SAME Indian LAW to abide by and most probably they had similar education qualifications too. 

--Yet they INTERPRETED the situation in absolutely CONTRASTING manner and gave verdicts which are poles apart. 

--Just imagine what would have happened if a YOUNG doctor sitting in a GOVERNMENT hospital doctor catering to hundreds of patients in a day had diagnosed a celebrity patient presenting with gastric discomfort as GASTRITIS and another hospital had LATER on diagnosed that patient to be having a MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. I am sure that doctor would have been screwed and jailed. 

--A JUDGE gets YEARS to decide on a case 
unlike a DOCTOR who is expected to diagnose and treat everything in the BLINK of an eye.

--If a doctor making a wrong diagnosis can be prosecuted shouldn't a judge giving wrong verdicts meet the same fate? 

--If hospitals can be sued for not admitting poor patients shouldn't the courts be prosecuted for having lacs of impending cases?

--Is it not appalling that a judge taking 12 years to give a wrong verdict gets away unhurt and a doctor making one mistake is screwed by our legal system?

--Doctors practice medicine which is more of an art than an exact science whereas law is absolutely 100% manmade, yet doctors are expected to be right on all occasions.

--If doctors and hospitals have a duty towards the society then does the judiciary not have a responsibility towards the socitey.

--If there is so much of hue and cry in media about doctors and hospitals charging huge sums from patients then why do we not ever hear a word on the fee that lawyers like Manu singhvi and Jethmalani charge for their court appearances.

--Government often talks about putting a capping on the fees doctors charge for various procedures but their is no talk of putting a capping on the fee that these lawyers charge to get justice for their clients. 

--If health is a citizen's right then so is justice. Shall we take our minds off worshipping false heroes & think? 

*JUDICIARY SHOULD ALSO COME UNDER CPA (CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT)*

Please share if you agree.

3/27/17, 8:33 PM - Maaruti2: Breaking news : Aparna Yadav and Pratik Yadav to join BJP. Also there is a gossip going on in public that secretly there will be full support to BJP Government from SP. Strict action can be taken on Azam Khan, Gayatri Prajapati and Ram Gopal Yadav. This is path changing politics in UP. This is also an end to Mayawati's BSP. Also rumours spreading that Ramveer Upadhyay who is from BSP and is a prominent Brahmin leader may join BJP along with his son. What will happen to the Mahathagbandhan of opposition initiated by Congress? Need views from everyone. Also I want to clear that Pratik and Aparna have never been involved in any kind of corruption. It is a 100% real news.

3/28/17, 9:07 PM - ANUPAM: What should be the goal of a 4-year BTech (CS) program? Should the goal be to learn just 4-5 courses in a half-baked fashion which will enable you to do a low-quality job in IT service industry, or get admission in a poor-quality MTech program in a Tier 2 institute. If that was the goal, then about 10% of the graduates are meeting that goal, and 90% are not.

However, as¬†media reported recently, HCL, the 4th largest IT service company will start hiring smart 12th class students and train them on those few things that they really need. The fact of the matter is that what can make you qualify in GATE (CS) is something that you can learn in a few months, you don't need a 4-year program, and that is exactly what the coaching industry is caching on.

3/29/17, 10:23 AM - ANUPAM: Ok. Valid point. BPL percentage in delhi might be 10% only. But it does exist.

Most of my patients, elderly who have been abandoned by their sons n daughters or refuse to buy them meds.
3/29/17, 10:24 AM - Maaruti2: Sir Govt hospital ke OPD ke baad bhi agar koi kahe ki Delhi ke Garibi Nahi to Kya Kaha jaaye

Then her son went to buy some meds. Then she called me. And started crying that her son had lost job. She pretended in front of son that she was OK, because she didn't want to see her son in pain. I also became emotional 

Roughly 20-30% of my patients are like this

There are some across delhi.
3/29/17, 10:35 AM - ANUPAM: Those meds which patients don't get for free .I tell them to go n take them from these shops
3/29/17, 10:36 AM - ANUPAM: Young people rich or poor also don't want to spend on their parents.
3/29/17, 10:40 AM - ANUPAM: http://www.satdiagnostic.com/facilities.htm

This trust gives very cheap and reasonable quality care and diagnostics at low cost. 

Eg. An echo test which will cost you 1500 outside, or free in govt hospital but with 2 month date, will be done in 300 here with waiting time of 4-5 hours

3/30/17, 9:25 AM - ANUPAM: Day 21- I am abruptly called by Arunabh at 6.45 PM. I am in the local back towards my home. He demands I come back to office. Apparently i have not finished some part of my work. I reluctantly come back. There are 3 people in office. 2 of them leave withing 5 minutes of me coming in. And Arunabh is sitting on a Chair in a casual manner. I walk up to him. He looks at me and asks me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äú Chaturbhuj Sthan ka naam suni ho‚Äù? I am stunned. For Non Starters, Chaturbhuj Sthan is the Red Light District of Muzaffarpur. I didnt respond. His second question- ‚ÄúHumko Chaturbhuj Sthan Bahut Pasand Hai. Udhar commercial deals hoti hain. Tum Bhi to commercial deal pe aayi ho‚Äù. I was getting where he was leading the discussion to. I avoided an interaction. I said ‚ÄúArunabh, aap bade bhai hain. Meri tabiyat thodi theek nahi hai. Kya karna hai bataiye. Hum karke ghar jaayenge‚Äù He suddenly holds my hand. Says ‚ÄúMadam, thoda role play karein‚Äù. I was stunned. None of this was something i had ever asked for. I ran away. Locked myself in the toilet. And cried. He went away. But i was thinking why the hell he is after me? What did i do to make this happen to me. That was the longest night of my life.

3/31/17, 12:23 PM - Satish: In the movie "Taare Zameen Par", the art teacher tells the rude & cursing father of the dyslexic kid about "Solomon Islands", where the tribals don‚Äôt cut down a tree. They surround the tree & curse it for hours every day. Within a few weeks, the tree
dries up & dies.

Difficult to believe?  How can intangible, invisible thoughts & words kill a tree?

If you read Bruce H. Lipton‚Äôs THE BIOLOGY OF BELIEF, you will think a dozen times before saying something demoralizing to yourself or to the people you love.

In this book, Mr. Lipton details the power of conscious & subconscious mind.

The subconscious mind is million times more powerful than the conscious mind & decides most of the things in our lives according to the beliefs it has.

Many times we fail to change an unpleasant habit despite our will-power & conscious efforts. It is because the habit gets so strongly programmed in our subconscious mind that the efforts made by our conscious mind hardly make any difference.

Conscious Mind is just a shadow of our Unconscious Mind..

So, when the tribals of Solomon Islands curse a tree, they are actually installing negative & harmful beliefs in the tree‚Äôs emotion (yes, trees have emotions).

Within few days, those negative emotions becomes a belief & eventually changes the molecular architecture of the tree & kill it from inside..

2500 years ago, when Buddha said ‚ÄòYou are what you think', actually he was telling a scientific fact which is now proved correct by Quantum Physics & Molecular Biology.

The book has a special chapter on Conscious Parenting where it talks about the beneficial & harmful effects of what parents say to their children..

If you are a parent and you keep cursing your child in the name of constructive criticism, you are installing beliefs in their mind which will keep harming them forever..

But if you keep appreciating them sincerely, you are installing beliefs in their mind which will help them in their entire life..*

Also be careful of what you keep saying to yourself.

Repetition of words & thoughts is the best way to install a belief in your subconscious mind.

If you keep saying you are a loser, don‚Äôt be surprised if you become a loser within a few months or years.

If your friends keep saying such things to you, there is no harm in saying a quick goodbye to them.

May be you value their friendship a lot. But you must value yourself more than such friendship.

Accept all people as they are. Love all people unconditionally.

Always keep saying to yourself I am healthy, wealthy, happy, successful & prosperous!

3/31/17, 2:30 PM - Pankaj Jha: An old lady handed her cheque to a bank teller and said, ‚ÄúI would like to withdraw ‚Çπ500..‚Äù 

The female teller told her, ‚ÄúFor withdrawals less than ‚Çπ5,000, please use the ATM‚Äù. 

The old lady then asked, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù The teller irritably told her, ‚ÄúThese are rules. Please leave if there is no other matter. There is a queue behind you.‚Äù She then returned the cheque to the old lady. 

The old lady remained silent. But she returned the cheque to the teller and said, ‚ÄúPlease help me withdraw all the money I have.‚Äù  

The teller was astonished when she checked the account balance. She nodded her head, leaned down and said to the old lady, ‚ÄúMy apologies Granny, you have ‚Çπ3.5 billion in your account and our bank does not have so much cash currently. Could you make an appointment and come again tomorrow?"

The old lady then asked, ‚ÄúHow much am I able to withdraw now?‚Äù 

The teller told her, ‚ÄúAny amount up to ‚Çπ300,000.‚Äù 

The old lady then told the teller that she wanted to withdraw ‚Çπ300,000 from her account. The teller did so quickly and handed it to the old lady respectfully. The old lady kept ‚Çπ500 in her bag and asked the teller to deposit the balance of ‚Çπ299,500 back into her account.  The teller was dumbfounded. 

The moral of this story is that rules are inflexible but we humans can be flexible when the situation requires us to be. We should not treat people based on their looks or how they are dressed. Rather, we should treat everyone with respect. And ... never be too quick to judge a book by its cover üòõ

3/31/17, 6:05 PM - Pankaj Jha: *Just too good*üëá

```At the point of death, a man, Tom Smith, called his children and he advised them to follow his footsteps so that they can have peace of mind in all that they do..

His daughter, Sara, said,
"Daddy, its unfortunate you are dying without a penny in your bank..
Other fathers' that you tag as being corrupt, thieves of public funds left houses and properties for their children; even this house we live in is a rented apartment..
Sorry, I can't emulate you, just go, let's chart our own course..

Few moments later, their father gave up the spirit..

Three years later, Sara went for an interview in a multinational company..
At interview the Chairman of the committee asked,
"Which Smith are you..??"

Sara replied,
"I am Sara Smith. My Dad Tom Smith is now late.."

Chairman cuts in,
"O my God, you are Tom Smith's daughter..?"

He turned to the  other members and said,
"This Smith man was the one that signed my membership form into the Institute of Administrators and his recommendation earned me where I am today. He did all these free. I didn't even know his address, he never knew me. He just did it for me.."
He turned to Sara,
"I have no questions for you, consider yourself as having gotten this job, come tomorrow, your letter will be waiting for you.."

Sara Smith became the Corporate Affairs Manager of the company with two Cars with Drivers, A duplex attached to the office, and a salary of ¬£1,00,000 per month excluding allowances and other costs..

After two years of working in the company, the MD of the company came from America to announce his intention to resign and needed a replacement. A personality with high integrity was sought after, again the company's Consultant nominated Sara Smith..

In an interview, she was asked the secret of her success,,

With tears, she replied, "My Daddy paved these ways for me. It was after he died that I knew that he was financially poor but stinkingly rich in integrity, discipline and honesty".

She was asked again, why she is weeping since she is no longer a kid as to miss her dad still after a long time..

She replied, "At the point of death, I insulted my dad for being an honest man of integrity. I hope he will forgive me in his grave now. I didn't work for all these, he did it for me to just walk in".

So, finally she was asked, "Will you follow your father's foot steps as he requested ?"

And her simple answer was, "l now adore the man, I have a big picture of him in my living room and at the entrance of my house. He deserves whatever I have after God".

Are you like Tom Smith..?
It pays to build a name, the reward doesn't come quickly but it will come however long it may take and it lasts longer..

Integrity, discipline, self control and fear of God makes a man wealthy, not the fat bank account..

Leave a good heritage for your children..

As an agent of CHANGE, please share this true life story with your loved ones..

God bless us all..```

4/3/17, 4:28 PM - Maaruti2: My wife left for her Father's home for vacation yesterday, when I was at my office. When I reached home, I found this note stuck on the television.  
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

I am going to My Mom's Place for 6-7 days with kids &
These are the instructions and warnings for you.... 

1 - No need to call your friends and cousins. 
Last time I got 4 large pizza bills beneath the sofa... 

2 - Don't forget mobile on the soap holder in the bathroom like last time... 

3 - Keep your specs in the box.. 
Last time around it was found in the refrigerator. 

4 - Salary already paid to maid. 
No need to be extra generous.

5 - Don't disturb neighbors early in the morning asking if they have got newspaper or not?? 
Our newspaper vendor is different from theirs.. 
And our laundry person and milkman are also different. 

6 - Your Underwear are on left side of wardrobe and on right side are kids'...
Like last time, don't say I was uncomfortable at work....

7 - All reports have been checked and you are alright.  
No need to go to that young lady doctor again and again.  

8 - My sister and Bhabhi's birthdays have  gone last month which you have already attended.  
No need to go to them at midnight and wish belated happy birthday.. 

9 - Have cut off WiFi for 10 days. 
So sleep early.... 

10 - Stop smiling and being happy... 
as Mrs. Khanna, Mrs. Avasthi, Mrs. Kulkarni, Mrs. Trivedi, Mrs. Ansari, Mrs. Rastogi, Mrs. Chatteerjee... 
They all will be out of station in this period.... 

11. Do not knock on the doors of that KALMUHI Priya, next door, on pretext of asking Sugar milk coffee powder or so one. I stocked all these in kitchen cabinet.  

And last but not the least.

12 - Don't try to be oversmart.. 
I  may be back any moment without informing you 

.
.

Happy vacation

4/4/17, 2:43 PM - Pankaj Jha: The Kapil Sharma Show has become a history. Professional things to learn from this:-

1. Everything that rises must fall.

2. You can't continue to rise or stay at the top by insulting your team mates. 

3. Don't break the 'Winning Team'.

4. People only worship the rising sun. 

5. Too much alcohol and ego is bad for your health. 

6. It takes years to make a reputation and takes minutes to lose it. 

7. You lose everything once u lose your reputation.

4/4/17, 5:28 PM - ANUPAM: Kya dikkat hai
4/4/17, 5:28 PM - Pankaj Jha: How can any sensible person equate Muharram with Ramanavami in India
4/4/17, 5:29 PM - Pankaj Jha: Jisko Jesus march nikalna hai Woh Vatican chala jaaye
4/4/17, 5:30 PM - ANUPAM: Again you are mistaking issue..
Why don't shia have right to carry out March while Hindus have..

Why double standards..

All or none
4/4/17, 5:30 PM - Pankaj Jha: Muharram wale Mecca jayein agar wahan k log aane dein to
4/4/17, 5:31 PM - ANUPAM: So basically you are making point that India is a Hindu country, hence Hindu appeasement hona chahiye in marches
4/4/17, 5:31 PM - Pankaj Jha: You just don't understand the difference between ramjada aur haramjada
4/4/17, 5:32 PM - Pankaj Jha: Appeasement??? Birth Right hai Ram ki santan k liye
4/4/17, 5:32 PM - ANUPAM: No but what is fault of Muslims or Christians in India, if mecca or Vatican doesn't allow Hindus there
4/4/17, 5:32 PM - Pankaj Jha: You may have doubts but India is a Hindu country
4/4/17, 5:33 PM - ANUPAM: Toh yeah birthright Indian Christian ka bhi Jai.
4/4/17, 5:33 PM - ANUPAM: Hai
4/4/17, 5:33 PM - ANUPAM: Not in constitution.
Unless it is amended.
4/4/17, 5:33 PM - Pankaj Jha: Their fault is they are not correcting the mistakes made by their forefathers because of compulsion and coercion
4/4/17, 5:34 PM - Pankaj Jha: It must be amended
4/4/17, 5:34 PM - ANUPAM: OK so they should do ghar waapsi or leave .
4/4/17, 5:34 PM - Pankaj Jha: They have to do path correction and do Ghar wapsi
4/4/17, 5:35 PM - Pankaj Jha: Ya take it or leave it
4/4/17, 5:35 PM - ANUPAM: Because they wouldn't have religious freedom to carry out marches which should be available to Hindus only..
4/4/17, 5:36 PM - Pankaj Jha: Woh utne hee Christian aur Muslim hain Jitna Rahul Ghandi "Ghandhi" hai
4/4/17, 5:37 PM - Pankaj Jha: Bhai ye Freedom aap Saudi Arabia mein maangia
4/4/17, 5:37 PM - Pankaj Jha: Wahan Na Mile to China aur US mein Muharram ka march nikaliye
4/4/17, 5:38 PM - Pankaj Jha: Ya phir London mein
4/4/17, 5:38 PM - Pankaj Jha: Sab March India mein hee niklega
4/4/17, 5:38 PM - ANUPAM: Boss I strongly disagree with preference to any religion.

Though I admit India is predominantly Hindu country hence their sentiments should be respected by minorities  to avoid conflict.
4/4/17, 5:38 PM - Pankaj Jha: You may agree or disagree
4/4/17, 5:39 PM - ANUPAM: But then why should Hindus have any objection to muharram or Jesus March.

Hinduism doesn't say anything about one god only
4/4/17, 5:39 PM - Pankaj Jha: But you can't ignore the truth that  India is Hindustan
4/4/17, 5:40 PM - ANUPAM: Or is it new version of Hinduism you are bringing like one true god n that is Ram like Christianity or islam
4/4/17, 5:43 PM - Maaruti2: That's true
4/4/17, 5:44 PM - Maaruti2: You won't find any Hindu calling other's God as Shaitan
4/4/17, 5:45 PM - Maaruti2: But many Believers would call Ram  names
4/4/17, 5:45 PM - ANUPAM: Hinduism respects other religions unlike desert religions..
That is its weakness AND strength
4/4/17, 5:46 PM - ANUPAM: Others believe in tolerance, we of Santana dharma believe in respect.

4/4/17, 5:57 PM - ANUPAM: Core right

Only a move towards Core Right can resurrect the Rule of Law in the Indian context. ¬†We are working on a detailed Core Right position but here is a sneak peek.

Education¬†: ¬†This is of the highest priority about ten times higher than item no 2 below. ¬†The Right to Education Act must be repealed, the 93rd Amendment overturned, and all the sectarian preferences in education prior to RTE must also be revisited. This is of utmost importance. Without this clarity and principle at the top, the lower cadre may not be able to grapple with the fallouts of such sectarianism.

Sectarian Purse: No 2 on Core Right is to preserve the secular nature of the public purse if you are to function as a coherent whole. ¬†The issue oddly, is not that the state spends on minority only issues like Haj where only minorities have an interest but on public goods like scholarships, schools, public works (MSDP), loans, etc. ¬†Areas where everyone has aspirations and interest. This is not to take away minority scholarships but to absorb the¬†part¬†into the¬†whole.¬†¬†The idea is to have common public goods and ensure equitable distribution within the program. Not to run separate programs.

Quota¬†:¬†Idea of India always had the danger that at some arbitrary point, the inside group (with benefits) would collaborate and prevent outside groups (without benefits) from gatecrashing. This is the essence of the Jat, Patidar, and Kapu issues. In¬†Idea of India¬†framework each of these groups should demonstrate their violence potential as proof of their grievance. The way to exit this loop is to enter a regime of open data about utilization of benefits on a component basis. Also borderline cases like Tamilnadu have to be taken up by the court for final disposition one way or another.

Temple¬†: For Hindu society to have a shot at self correction (expel the beef brahmin and elevate¬†the dalit) it must have in its control institutions. ¬†By appropriating all the temple wealth for secular purposes, this institutional capacity is taken away while Churches have a large capacity to present to their flock in terms of education and hospitals. ¬†That in essence is the matter of temple control. There are some issues around the kind of trust¬†to which this will be handed over. But for starters ‚Äì there can be a central law that mandates¬†‚Äòlabeling‚Äô and ‚Äòchanneling‚Äô of temple revenues. More on this later.

Essential religious practice¬†: A constitution amendment that would put cultural practices like Jallikattu, Nag Panchami, Dahi Handi and all others out of reach of simple PIL process in the courts. If US based NGOs like PETA want to ban Jallikattu they should be made to go to Parliament and use the statutory route. This makes it to the Core Right list because the security of such practices are essential to a pagan religion.

Cow slaughter¬†: Need to have ¬†a better law that openly says that cows get protection due to their special position in Hindu religion. The laws also have to be deeper and more well thought out. An example might be for outlaw and enforce in letter the killing of male calves. Today the laws are worded as if the target is the butcher, consumer, and not the seller and the calf-killer. Can also institute¬†a permanent amnesty regime by micro-chipping the herds. Today, if Congress comes back in MH the herds who are immune from slaughter today can be picked up. ¬†The costs of maintaining cattle must also be borne as far as possible by Hindus via tax deductions and special assessments on temples.

One the Core Right process is started, the first ground rule: NO PRIVATE VIOLENCE should be tolerated. ¬†The reason the state has no majesty in front of Jats and Kapus is that we do not have any answers to their questions. ‚ÄúWhy cant I get what you are giving him‚Äù. Once you have a Core Right agenda in place, the state will restore its majesty and able to assert itself and claw its way back out of Idea of India land.

4/5/17, 6:26 AM - Pankaj Jha: This is d best interpretation I have read about *Rama* and *Ramayana* 

 The Interpretation of *Ramayana*
As a *Philosophy of Life*..

‚Äò *Ra* ‚Äô means *light*, ‚Äò *Ma* ‚Äô means *within me*, *in my heart*. 
So, 
*Rama* means the *Light Within Me*..

*Rama* was born to *Dasharath & Kousalya*.

*Dasharath* means ‚Äò *Ten Chariots* ‚Äô..
The ten chariots symbolize the *five sense organs*( *Gnanendriya* ) & *five organs of action*( *Karmendriya* ) ..

*Kousalya* means ‚Äò *Skill* ‚Äô..

*The skillful rider of the ten chariots can give birth to Ram*..

When the ten chariots are used skillfully,
*Radiance* is born within..

*Rama* was born in *Ayodhya*.
*Ayodhya* means ‚Äò *a place where no war can happen* ‚Äô..

When There Is No Conflict In Our Mind, Then The Radiance Can Dawn..

The *Ramayana* is not just a story which happened long ago..
It has a *philosophical*, *spiritual significance* and a *deep truth* in it..

It is said that the *Ramayana is happening in our Own Body*.

Our *Soul* is *Rama*, 
Our *Mind* is *Sita*, 
Our *Breath* or *Life-Force* ( *Prana*) is *Hanuman*, 
Our *Awareness* is *Laxmana* and 
Our *Ego* is *Ravana*..

When the *Mind* (Sita),is stolen by the *Ego* (Ravana), then the *Soul* (Rama) gets *Restless*..

Now the *SOUL* (Rama) cannot reach the *Mind* (Sita) on its own.. 
It has to take the help of the *Breath ‚Äì the Prana* (Hanuman) by Being In *Awareness*(Laxmana)

With the help of the *Prana* (Hanuman), & *Awareness*(Laxmana),
The *Mind* (Sita) got reunited with The *Soul* (Rama) and The *Ego* (Ravana) *died/ vanished*..

*In reality Ramayana is an eternal phenomenon happening all the time*..

4/6/17, 6:46 PM - Kashif: If Muslims can get holiday for Mohammad birthday, christians for Good Friday , Sikh for guru Nanak and guru gobind, Dalits for ambedkar then why not Hindus
4/6/17, 6:47 PM - Kashif: For Ramnavmi

4/6/17, 6:54 PM - Kashif: And my opposition to ambedkar getting special treatment
4/6/17, 6:55 PM - Maaruti2: So I told you Ambedkar got special treatment because Ambedkar in India gets reservation

4/6/17, 9:37 PM - ANUPAM: Q: The emphasis on English education will come as a surprise to your critics because of your image as someone who is a traditionalist.

Yogi : The traditional and the modern should blend. We have to be aware of our values and protect them. We should also have an education system which promotes nationalism but which is modern. ¬†

But education system needs some overhaul. Examinations should also be over¬†and results should be out¬†in 15 days. Only two things happen in this country: elections and examinations.

4/11/17, 7:52 AM - Pankaj Jha: Dear friends ...

Here is Ice-cream update - 
Amul has won a lawsuit against Walls, Kwality and some other branded icecream makers. They can no longer sell their products as icecream. Hence the new marketing name is 'frozen desserts'. If you check labels of items sold as frozen desserts it does say hydrogenated vegetable oil which is dalda! So if its frozen dessert, its definately dalda. You can check the packs. This is ice cream season. All our children love to eat it, so be aware that AMUL is the only ice cream manufacturer who makes icecream from milk not from vegetable fats..
Just read the link

4/16/17, 11:21 AM - ANUPAM: Today you see videos of a soldier armed with an AK47 being slapped by a Kashmiri youth. That itself tells you that they are under immense pressure not to react. I spoke to a young Kashmiri in Srinagar and asked him ‚Äúpatthar kyu phenkte ho? Darr nahi lagta?‚Äù (Why do you pelt stones? Aren‚Äôt you afraid of the consequences?) He said ‚Äúkya baat kar rahe hai sahab, CRPF ki himmat thodi hai kuch karne ki, hum to unke muh pe thuk ke chale jaate hai‚Äù (What are you saying!? CRPF doesn‚Äôt have the courage to do anything, we even spit at their face and come back). And this fellow will never try this with an Indian Army soldier.

The problem is with the leadership. The Indian Army is led by General Rawat. 30 years back, he was a second lieutenant in the Gorkha Rifles. He has seen the ground reality. He owes loyalty to that institution. The problem with CRPF is that most of their top management is imported. These are IPS officers. If you are senior enough, you can become DG of CRPF. They might not have seen one day of Kashmir or any sort of counter insurgency operations. And they lead a force that is heavily involved in counter insurgency and internal security operations.

Doctors pushing for branded 
Bhai if you are so concerned. Write molecule name and ask him to take from a good brand.
Why panicking..Because ur commission/cut/party/conference is lost ?
4/24/17, 7:38 PM - ANUPAM: Is a doctor competent enough to compare bioavailability of brand A vs brand B, that can be done only in a controlled trial..

The answer is no..

Patient response depends on so many things ..Correct diagnosis, stage of diagnosis, bioavailability n many other things..

In an alcohol factory the regular tester died and the director started looking for a new one to hire.

A drunkard with a ragged, dirty look came to apply for the position.

The director of the factory wondered how to send him away. They tested him.

They gave him a glass with a drink. He tried it and said, "It's red wine, a muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers."

"That's correct", said the boss.

Another glass. "It's red wine, cabernet, eight years old, a south western slope, oak barrels."

"Correct." The director was astonished. He winked at his secretary to suggest something.

She brought in a glass of urine. The alcoholic tried it.

"It's a blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant, made inside the office. And if you don't give me the job, I'll also tell who's the father!"

The boss collapsed...üòú

4/26/17, 8:24 AM - ANUPAM: In a bizarre move, though, according to a news report in The Times of India, with some stent manufacturers keen to withdraw premium stents from the market, the government has directed these firms to maintain their production of stents using its powers under Section 3(i) of the Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO)‚Äîwhile the current order will be in force for six months, it could be extended. During this period, companies have been asked to submit a weekly report of the stents produced and distributed along with the plan for the next week.
4/26/17, 8:26 AM - ANUPAM: Minimum government my foot.

4/26/17, 9:52 AM - ANUPAM: I personally believe that doctors should write molecule name legibly.with brand name in brackets..

But that's my opinion, not MCI or government.
In absence of it, doctors writing it can suggest verbally to buy reputed brands.

Coming to allergic reaction,
I have given multiple janaushadhi B12 injection without reaction..
Have had reactions with B1 injections from branded medicines as well.

If the government has introduced this policy..Then it is important for it to offer quality generics at cheap cost with quality assurance n quality  control.
4/26/17, 9:54 AM - ANUPAM: Because while there might be genuine allergic reactions due to bad quality. 
It is also true that every such incident will be replayed by complicit doctors n pharma manifold who have hidden interest in hiking cost of health care.
4/26/17, 9:57 AM - ANUPAM: This is my broad opinion.
60-70% doctors are honest due to genuine honesty or majboori write medicines according to brand or recall value,
30-40% doctors are actively complicit in cuts..
These 30% would write you wrong medications but would deliberately write ones where they get a cut.
4/26/17, 11:43 AM - Abhishek: No issue with generic 
But it should be of the best quality

4/26/17, 10:42 PM - vishalsatish: Not Vulgarity But Knowledge??

In Ancient England, People Could Not Have Sex Without King's Permission.

To Have A Baby, They Were Supposed To Get King's Consent.

They Were Then Given A Card To Hang On Their Door While Having Sex,

Which Read As: "Fornication Under The Consent of King" (F.U.C.K.)

So The Word 'Fuck' Came In to Existence..!

Anybody knew about this.....?? 

Simply saying Fuck Fuck .....‚ò∫

E.g. take the word  *Ultracrepidarian*

It means _"A person who gives his opinion and advice on matters outside of one's knowledge or competence."_

Here, in India, we simply call him a *Chutia Saala* !

A Delhi mother was lucky enough to see her 3 daughters get married the same year, so she called them after the wedding and told them

 "Dont forget to text me your first night experience and text it in code" 

So....... after a week, the 1st daughter texted 

"NESCAFE" 

and the next week the 2nd daughter text 

"WILLS" 

the mother being an intelligent woman went to get a Nescafe tin and read the label 

"fantastic till the last drop"

 went to her husband's pack of WILLS cigarette and read 
"Extra long, king size" 

she smiled and said "not bad for their ages". 

After the next week, the 3rd daughter texted 

"Indigo Delhi Hyderabad", 

the mother then called Indigo airways helpdesk to enquire about their Delhi Hyderabad flight and they replied 

"it's 5times daily, 7days a week, both ways and the flight duration is  75mins".

Mother fainted

Normal Politician: People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
Shashi Tharoor: Individuals who make their abodes in vitreous edifices would be advised to refrain from catapulting perilous projectiles.

Normal Politician: Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
Shashi Tharoor: Scintillate, scintillate, asteroid minim.

Normal Politician: All that glitters is not gold.
Shashi Tharoor: All articles that coruscate with resplendence are not truly auriferous.

Normal Politician: Beggars are not choosers.
Shashi Tharoor: Sorting on the part of mendicants must be interdicted.

Normal Politician: Dead men tell no tales.
Shashi Tharoor: Male cadavers are incapable of rendering any testimony.

Normal Politician: Beginner's luck.
Shashi Tharoor: Neophyte's serendipity.

Normal Politician: Birds of a feather flock together.
Shashi Tharoor: Members of an avian species of identical plumage tend to congregate.

Normal Politician: Beauty is only skin deep.
Shashi Tharoor: Pulchritude possesses solely cutaneous profundity.

Normal Politician: Cleanliness is godliness.
Shashi Tharoor: Freedom from incrustations of grime is contiguous to rectitude.

Normal Politician: There's no use crying over spilt milk.
Shashi Tharoor: It is fruitless to become lachrymose of precipitately departed lactile fluid.

Normal Politician: You can't try to teach an old dog new tricks.
Shashi Tharoor: It is fruitless to attempt to indoctrinate a superannuated canine with innovative maneuvers.

Normal Politician: Look before you leap.
Shashi Tharoor: Surveillance should precede saltation.

Normal Politician: He who laughs last, laughs best.
Shashi Tharoor: The person presenting the ultimate cachinnation possesses thereby the optimal cachinnation.

Normal Politician: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
Shashi Tharoor: Exclusive dedication to necessitous chores without interludes of hedonistic diversion renders Jack a hebetudinous fellow.

Normal Politician: Where there's smoke, there's fire!
Shashi Tharoor: Where there are visible vapours having their provenance in ignited carbonaceous materials, there is conflagration.

5/24/17, 7:30 PM - vishalsatish: If you are Muslim and suddenly start feeling unsafe in country where you lived for more than thousand years..

 If you are Dalit and start feeling insulted on every moment of life.. 

If you are Hindu and suddenly start feeling that cows are being slaughtered everywhere... 

If you are a Jain and suddenly start feeling that your religious piety is being compromised...

Just do one thing... 

Stay away from social media... 
Don't watch news...
Don't go behind politicians...
Stay away from debates on religion...

And you will find that you are living in one of the best countries of the world!! üëç

5/26/17, 6:58 AM - ANUPAM: All this was accepted by everyone in Delhi as long as CBSE was inflating more than others. And usually, CBSE was inflating marks of Delhi students more than marks of outside Delhi students. To enable this difference, CBSE would actually prepare a different paper for Delhi and a different one for the rest of India, and could claim that Delhi students will have larger increase since Delhi paper was more difficult. No evidence of difficult was ever deemed necessary (since the goal appeared to be admission to DU).

Me - sir, abc@xyz.com

Interviewer - and password?

Me - 12345678

Interviewer - you shared such a confidential information so easily for the job. How can we trust that you will not share any confidential information of the company for some better offers?

Me - Sir, I might have shared my password with you but I don't think you can still login to my email account. Let's look for the possibilities. My password can be

12345678

Or

Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneight

Or

1twothreefourfivesixseveneight

1twothreefourfivesixseven8‚Ä¶.. so on

Or

6/15/17, 7:23 AM - Kashif: Indian banking system is imploding but since its predominantly Govt owned so it's a slow death!

All foreign banks except 3 or 4 have left India!

4th major Indian bank which has about 5,000 branches and about 40,000 employees has been put into a stage where it cannot lend any more due to the sheer amount of bad loans due to all sectors going down simultaneously for the last 2-3 years!

6 banks were merged 6 months ago and now 4 are about to collapse so they will be merged so that shuffling of musical chairs in the Titanic can continue before it all sinks!

But no one questions who is getting all this money and where does it exactly go while leaving a huge hole in pockets of the tax payer? 

Entire Govt is being looted in front of our eyes and thousands will lose jobs! 

Even Indian Railways is going to fire 11,000 employees for the first time it's 164 year history!

After an initial examination, the doctor explained to them that, 
Though rare, His condition (Donkey Doodle) could be fixed through corrective Surgery.

How long will he be on crutches?" His wife asked anxiously.

"Crutches? Why would he need crutches?" responded the surprised doctor.

6/27/17, 5:55 PM - Maaruti: Amitabh Bacchan decides to drive his new Aston Martin luxury car and asks his driver to sit on the back seat.

A Police Hawaldar stops the car for jumping the signal.

On seeing Amitabh driving the car, he calls his ACP and asks him "Sir signal jumping ke liye gaadi rokki hai. Lekin challan nahi de sakta. Gadi mein bahut bada Sahab baitha hai. Kya karoon?"

ACP asks "Kaun sahab hai gaadi main?"

Hawaldar "Pata nahi kaun sahab hai. Lekin usne Amitabh Bachhan ko driver rakha hai."

Amitabh shocked !!!

Husband: It is not so easy to understand. Okay, listen to me; I will try to explain with a very simple example of my life.
When I was not married, if I came home at late night, first I had to give explanation to my sister at the door why I was so late. Then, it is to my mother and lastly to my father. Now after marriage, if I get late, I dnt need to give explanation for three times, only single explanation to you solves the problem. 
This is the brief idea about GST. Now are you clear?

7/3/17, 10:32 PM - apurvaprakash: This is a great analogy:

*You are holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and shoves you or shakes your arm, making you spill your coffee everywhere. Why did you spill the coffee?*

"Well because someone bumped into me, of course!"

Wrong answer.

You spilled the coffee because coffee was in the cup. 
If tea had been in it, you would have spilled tea.

 Whatever is inside the cup is what will come out.

Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which will happen), whatever is inside of you will come out. It's easy to fake it until you get rattled.

So we have to ask ourselves....what's in my cup? 

When life gets tough, what spills over? 
Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility?
 Or anger, bitterness, harsh words and actions?
*You choose!*

Today let's work towards filling our cups with gratitude, forgiveness, joy, words of affirmation to yourself and others, kindness, gentleness, and love...

Cumulative change in gum sales in USA since iphone came out. Chewing gum sales have declined 15 % in US since 2007, the year the iPhone came out, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.
Most gum is sold on supermarket checkout lines - a strategic spot to place sweet impulse buys while we wait in queue. But we‚Äôre now so consumed with our phones that we‚Äôre no longer looking around for stuff to beat boredom.

7/9/17, 9:24 AM - ANUPAM: It is not surprising then that the most passionate defenses of Amazon and similar companies come from the Brahmins of the company, those that get paid the most, because they have been made to believe, through the whole data-driven mumbo jumbo that they are, LO‚ÄôReal style, ‚Äúworth it‚Äù. The touchy-feely ‚Äúwe care‚Äù side of the company is exposed only to them, which is why they are genuinely gobsmacked when they hear of other employees in the same organization having radically different experiences. For instance Netflix rolled out paid maternity leave to its employees but only in its online streaming side, not the humble DVD-packers or the customer-service reps [Link]. I am sure there is some data-scientist (or a few) who earned their pay here, and a bunch of employees rolling their eyes at the complainers and moochers.

Which brings me to the point of the post. Empathy.

The modern organization, and specially the post-modern one that visionaries like Bezos dream of, do not plan for empathy. Yes empathy needs to be planned for, else it is just a nice word in a CEO note. Empathy means designing redundancy into an organization, such that the lady who has had a stillborn child is allowed a period of ‚Äúlow performance‚Äù because there is someone else who can pick up that work, without making that someone else burn out. That kind of planning of course almost never happens in the modern organization, especially for those at the lower end of the value scale, because the mantra is of leanness, of being pared to the bone, with no redundant cost-centers.

And if you think this is bad, you haven‚Äôt seen the future yet. The next wave of automation is rumbling to shore, and Amazon is at the crest of that.¬†

7/11/17, 1:11 PM - Maaruti: Husband and wife went shopping to get new sarees for the wife.

After seeing numerous sarees, she shortlisted around 100 and further brought it down to 25.

 Out of these she asked her husband to choose 5 sarees among them.

Then she finally picked up one saree.
It took 5 hours to finalise one saree.

The husband settled the bill and commented :"Adam was very lucky because he and Eve used to wear only leaves. He need not have wasted too much of time.

Ultimate comment of wife:- Who knows how many trees Adam had to climb and finally choose the leaves as per the wish of Eve. You are lucky u have to just sit in AC shop ...

7/13/17, 9:20 PM - ANUPAM: Public signs say no one is permitted to pray in public or grow a beard before the age of 50, while government employees are forbidden from fasting during Ramzan.

In Tashkurgan, near the Pakistan border, authorities shut a halal restaurant as "punishment" for refusing to serve food during the holiday, according to a shopkeeper working next door.

A teacher and a government official said that schools discourage students from using the traditional Arabic Muslim greeting "As-Salaam Alaikum" ("peace be upon you").

"The government thinks this Islamic word is equal to separatism," the official said.
7/13/17, 9:21 PM - ANUPAM: the mostly¬†Muslim Uighur populationhave stifled life in the tense¬†Xinjiangregion, where beards are partially banned and no one is allowed to pray in public.


For years, the square outside the mosque in Kashgar was packed with teeming crowds as worshippers jostled for space to unroll their prayer rugs and celebrate the end of Ramzan. But no longer.

7/16/17, 9:35 PM - Maaruti: The wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman and was somewhat upset 

-"you are a disrespectful pig!" she cried. 

How dare you do this to me -a faithful wife, mother of your children!

 I am leaving you. 

I want a divorce straight away!"

 And the husband replied "Hang on  just a minute Love, so at least I can tell you what happened." 

"Fine, go ahead," she sobbed, "but they'll be the last words you'll ever say to me!! 

And the  husband began -" Well I was getting into the car to drive home and this young lady here asked me for a lift.

 She looked so down and out and so defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car. 

I noticed that she was thin, poorly dressed and dirty. 

She told me that she hadn't eaten for  three days! 

So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the chicken curry I made for you last night, which you wouldn't eat because you are afraid you'll put on weight.

The poor thing devoured them in seconds. 

Since she needed a good clean up I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that I noticed that her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away. 

Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't use because you say they are too tight. 

I also gave her the underwear that was your Anniversary present, which you don't use because I don't have good taste.

 I went and found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas, which you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated the boots you bought at that expensive boutique  and don't use because someone in your office has the same pair" 

The husband took a deep breath and continued- "she was so grateful for my understanding and help and as I walked her to the door she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, 

" Please, do you have anything else that your wife  DOESN'T USE?"

8/6/17, 9:12 PM - Pankaj Jha: The late Bimal Roy was making "Bandini" and Shailendra was writing the lyrics for its songs. Sachin Dev Burman was the music director. There was some altercation between Shailendra and Burman, who then refused to work with Shailendra. 
Bimal Roy was worried.  Somebody told him about a Sardarji,  *Sampuran Singh Kalra*, a motor car mechanic who had migrated from Pakistan & was looking for a chance to write lyrics. Motor mechanic who wrote lyrics? People asked in amazement but by then the desperate Bimal Roy said ok, bring him in. 
So Sampuran Singh was entertained and given the scene and story line. He then wrote his FIRST EVER FILM SONG! 

Bimald Roy's gamble paid off for what a hit  song it was!

and a living legend was born!!  his very first song from "Bandini" - _*"Mora gora rang laile, mohe shaam rang daidey"*_ sung by none other than Lata Mangeshkar.

Sardar Sampuran Singh Kalra later changed his name and became whom we know as the legend *"Gulzar"*!üëáüèºüëáüèº

The following message from New Zealand is forwarded as received..... 


A New Zealander's view on reason for corruption in India:

Indians are Hobbesian (Culture of self interest)

Corruption in India is a cultural aspect. Indians seem to think nothing peculiar about corruption. It is everywhere.  

Indians tolerate corrupt individuals rather than correct them. 

No race can be congenitally corrupt.

But can a race be corrupted by its culture?  

To know why Indians are corrupt, look at their patterns and practices.

Firstly:
Religion is transactional in  India.

Indians give God cash and anticipate an out-of-turn reward. 

Such a plea acknowledges that favours are needed for the undeserving.  

In the world outside the temple walls, such a transaction is named ‚Äúbribe‚Äù.  

A wealthy Indian gives not cash to temples, but gold crowns and such baubles. 

His gifts can not feed the poor. His pay-off is for God. He thinks it will be wasted if it goes to a needy man. 

In June 2009, The Hindu published a report of Karnataka minister G. Janardhan Reddy gifting a crown of gold and diamonds worth Rs 45 crore to Tirupati. 

India‚Äôs temples collect so much that they don't know what to do with it. Billions are gathering dust in temple vaults. 

When Europeans came to India  they built schools. When Indians go to Europe & USA, they build temples. 

Indians believe that if God accepts money for his favours, then nothing is wrong in doing the same thing. This is why Indians are so easily corruptible. 

Indian culture accommodates such transaction 

First: Morally. There is  no real stigma. An  utterly corrupt politician can make a comeback, just unthinkable in the West. 

Secondly:
Indian moral ambiguity towards corruption is visible in its history. Indian history tells of the capture of cities and kingdoms after guards were paid off to open the gates, and commanders paid off to surrender. 

This is unique to India. 

Indians' corrupt nature has meant limited warfare on the subcontinent.

It is striking how little Indians have actually fought compared to ancient  Greece and modern Europe. 

The Turk's battles with Nadir Shah were vicious and fought to the finish. 

In India fighting wasn't needed, bribing was enough to see off armies. 

Any invader willing to spend cash could brush aside India‚Äôs kings, no matter how many tens of thousands soldiers were in their infantry. 

Little resistance was given by the Indians at the ‚ÄúBattle‚Äù of Plassey. 

Clive paid off Mir Jaffar and all of Bengal folded to an army of 3,000. 

There was always a financial exchange to taking Indian forts. Golconda was captured in 1687 after the secret back door was left open. 

Mughals vanquished Marathas and Rajputs with nothing but bribes. 

The Raja of Srinagar gave up Dara Shikoh‚Äôs son Sulaiman to Aurangzeb after receiving a bribe. 

There are many cases where Indians participated on a large scale in treason due to bribery. 

Question is: Why Indians have a transactional culture while other 'civilized' nations don't? 

Thirdly:
Indians do not believe in the theory that they all can rise if each of them behaves morally, because that is not the message of their faith. 

Their caste system separates them. 

They don't believe that all men are equal. 

This resulted in their division and migration to other religions. 

Many Hindus started their own faith like Sikh, Jain, Buddha and many converted to Christianity and Islam. 

The result is that Indians don't trust one another. 

There are no Indians in India, there are Hindus, Christians, Muslims and what not. 

Indians forget that 1400 years ago they all belonged to one faith. 

This division evolved an unhealthy culture. The inequality has resulted in a corrupt society, in India every one is thus against everyone else, except God and even he must be bribed.
Indians are also famous in the world since British time

* If poison expires, is it more poisonous or is it no longer poisonous?

* Which letter is silent in the word "Scent," the S or the C?

* Do twins ever realize that one of them is unplanned?

 

* Why is the letter W, in English, called double U? Shouldn't it be called double V?

* Maybe oxygen is slowly killing you and It just takes 75-100 years to fully work.

* Every time you clean something, you just make something else dirty.

* The word "swims" upside-down is still "swims".

* Intentionally losing a game of rock, paper, scissors is just as hard as trying to win.

* 100 years ago everyone owned a horse and only the rich had cars. Today everyone has cars and only the rich own horses.

* Your future self is watching you right now through memories.

* The doctors that told Stephen Hawking he had two years to live in 1953 are probably dead.

* If you replace "W" with "T" in "What, Where and When", you get the answer to each of them.

* Many animals probably need glasses, but nobody knows it.

* If you rip a hole in a net, there are actually fewer holes in it than there were before.

* If 2/2/22 falls on a Tuesday, we'll just call it "2's Day".

8/25/17, 4:33 PM - apurvaprakash: A trader was going to Kasi by boat. 

*Chapter 1* - Casualty
On the way, his boat started sinking. He saw a fisherman on a nearby boat and asked him to take him aboard and save him. He told the fisherman that otherwise he would drown and die. And that if he took him aboard, then he would give him all his property. The fisherman agreed. 

*Chapter 2* -  ICU
Once the boat started moving safely towards the shore, the trader regained his senses and started repenting for having offered all his property to the fisherman. Then he told the fisherman that although he was ready to give him all his property, his wife would not agree to it, so he would only give him half of it, as he had to give the other half to his wife and family. The fisherman kept silent and continued rowing towards the shore. 

*Chapter 3* - Ward
Then the trader wondered why he had offered him half his property. What great thing had he done by saving him from the river? It is his duty to ferry people across, and, after all, protecting others is only humane. He was just doing his duty and would have committed a sin if he had not saved him. He had actually protected the fisherman from committing a sin. So he told the fisherman he would only give him a quarter of his property. The fisherman did not make a sound. 

*Epilogue* - At time of discharge
When they reached the shore, the trader gave him a five rupee coin and said "you take this. Have tea for yourself and get some biscuits for your children.'‚Äù

Later he sued the fisherman because of the abrasion he had sustained while the fisherman pulled him out of water. 

He filed a case saying that all problems he has today is because of the abrasion and not because of near drowning. 

The court ruled that not only the fisherman was negligent but also money minded.
Any relation to medical profession is coincidental....

When all hell breaks down and you finally conclude that the system is too screwed up to be restored in this country, you come across certain individuals who restore your  faith. One such individual is SP (CBI) Satish Dagar who is the investigation officer in the RamRahim rape case. 

To understand the might of this Godman, there are few examples: after BJP govt was formed in Haryana , CM Khattar went to the den of this man with whole cabinet  to render their gratitude and seek his blessings. During Last assembly elections, Punjab Congress was grinning ear to ear after getting open blessings from the baba and so was BJP this time . Central govt allotted Z+ security to him and bureaucrats and ministers danced to the tune of him. But then, you meet an officer like Dagar who didn't break under the mountainous pressure from the political class and did his job. He chose his side: to get justice to the two hapless Sadhvi sisters who were assaulted. 

You need to look no farther than the journalist Ramchandra Chhatrapati who published a small newspaper in Sirsa and openly broke out a story about women being molested in the Dera despite the plethora of threats . Chhatrapati was brutally murdered soon after he refused to toe the line. 

You need to look no farther than those two Sadhvi sisters who didn't buckle under the pressure despite the mighty state machinery and a sea of hooligans threatening them. 

You need to look no farther than the judges of Panchkula court and Haryana-Punjab court who stood with the truth and not with the side whom the majority favoured . 

These are the people who keep my faith in humanity alive. These are the individuals who strengthen my belief in the idea of India...üáÆüá≥

In his quest to be mahatma..He indulged in evil sexual experiments.

Don't get so upset with the Dera followers just because of a little beating they gave you. They were emotionally unstable and did it in the heat of the moment. 
Cheer up and keep being sympathetic towards them.

9/28/17, 10:15 PM - Pankaj Jha: If a former Finance Minister, that too from within the BJP, finds fault with the state of the economy, normally, it should be treated as a matter of concern. But when one remembers that Yashwant Sinha has been a routine critic of Narendra Modi and his radical political moves to transform India, it in fact creates hope, not despair.

This is why.

Yashwant Sinha is not an economist. His tenure as Finance Minister was disastrous and shook the faith of the middle class who voted whole-heartedly for the BJP in the 1998 and 1999 elections. The BJP had to pay a heavy price for the UTI scam that affected and shook the faith of the small investor. This along with falling returns on fixed deposits, financial instruments, pension schemes and Provident Funds shattered the faith of the common man in the reform process and that put the BJP on the backfoot for two successive general elections. Farmer distress allowed the Congress to head for the elections with a promise to waive loans, which the UPA famously executed in the fourth year of its first term, leading to a big win in the 2009 election. Yashwant Sinha had become so unpopular with the BJP cadre that finally Atal Behari Vajpayee replaced him with Jaswant Singh, who, as Finance Minister, then retrieved the economy, leading to the "India Shining" slogan of 2004. Perhaps Vajpayee lost because he advanced the polls by over six months, before the fruits of India Shining could percolate to the masses.¬†


High onion prices and a general failure to address the scarcity of certain essential commodities plus the failure to control prices and some questionable disinvestments had created a feeling that the government was too right of centre. This alienated the working class, leading to Sangh affiliates like the¬†Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh¬†and the¬†Swadeshi Jagaran Manchraising the banner of revolt against the then NDA government. The widely-publicized golden handshake and VRS schemes in the PSUs, along with the closing down of many loss-making units, adversely impacted the BJP prospects. Yashwant Sinha gave no credible rational explanation for any of these follies. In fact, Sinha had taken charge of the Finance portfolio convincing the¬†Swadeshi¬†leadership that he was their friend and opposed to the IMF template of liberalization, but within months he betrayed their trust.

Yashwant Sinha, as Finance Minister of the Chandra Shekhar government, pawned Indian gold for the first time in our history. It was the most shameful phase in India's economic history.

The Modi government's liberalization policies have to be judged in this background. Sinha is not really giving any economic argument to besmirch the Modi government's economic initiatives. Rather, he is spreading a fear factor and trying to build political arguments to damage the image of the BJP government. He is critical of both demonetisation and GST. He has been critical of the government's foreign policy, Kashmir policy, anti-terror operations and even about exposing Pakistan as the terror incubator of the world. So criticism is his habit.

Narendra Modi has been following a well-charted path. His economics is clear for all those who wanted to understand it. This writer had hailed demonetisation in an¬†earlier column¬†as "Modi's proud socialist moment". He has shown the guts to introduce far-reaching economic and tax reforms - demonetisation and GST - within a span of eight months. Yet, there has been no big disruption or turmoil in the economy. Those who opposed these reforms had predicted a steep fall in growth and huge job losses. Both did not happen.

The Indian economy is still the fastest-growing in the world. The growth is still substantially high, almost double of what the BJP inherited from the UPA in 2014. The Modi-Jaitley team should be given credit for not only restoring investor confidence and putting the economy on the growth path, but also managing it so well.

Modi's objective as PM was very transparent from day one. He said he will account for every single penny spent from the exchequer. He wanted to increase revenue, fight the deficit, widen the ¬†tax net, fight corruption, unearth black money, eliminate fake currency and attract FDI into India by enhancing the ease of doing business. Now India is the most preferred destination for FDI if the last two years of inflow is any indication.

Inflation is down to three per cent, lending rates are consistently coming down, projects like Make in India, Skill India and Stand Up, India have started showing positive results. Nobody has so far denied that there was a parallel economy of black and fake currency. Modi took the first concrete step to unearth black money and destroy fake currency. It is also well-known that almost one third, that is around five lakh crore of the high-denomination currency issued by the RBI, was untraceable because of hoarding by black money holders. After demonetisation, the RBI has said that 99 per cent of the banned currency has been deposited in banks. This shows how successful demonetisation was. The money that has returned to the banks is all not white. It only shows that the money so far untraced has now come into the open. These hoarders need to be prosecuted and tax collected from them.

Sinha has questioned tax notices. In a country where only 4 per cent of the people pay income tax, even if all the tax payers get notices, it will still not be widespread. Yes, they are a very influential class. In a country where one per cent of the population is holding 58 per cent of the national wealth, some sort of affirmative action had to be taken. And Modi has done it. Yashwant Sinha is speaking as if he holds a brief for these hoarders, black money and fake currency peddlers.

The difference Modi has made is in the lives of the millions who so far had nobody to speak for. That is why Modi has transformed the BJP base and emerged the messiah of the poor. He is the greatest leveler India has seen. A huge redistribution of wealth is taking shape.

Before taking up painful economic reforms, Modi created an economic safety net with free LPG connections to BPL families, insurance cover for the poor, old and destitute, housing, toilets and electricity for all, health insurance and crop insurance for farmers, Mudra bank loans for small traders. These are all changing the economic landscape of India and giving hope for those who form the lion's share of India. For them, the economy is looking up. Those in ivory towers will never see this.
